If you find yourself cooking at home more than going out right now, groceries are probably a significant part of your monthly budget. That means you'll want to earn as much cash back or travel points on your supermarket purchases as you can. The good news is that not only are there a number of great credit cards for grocery shopping, some cards currently even feature limited-time bonuses on groceries. But which credit card is best for groceries right now? CNN Underscored has picked our current favorite credit cards to use at the supermarket. The right card truly depends on your needs and shopping habits, but rest assured — there's a card for everyone. The best credit cards for groceries in November 2020 Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Best for cash back at US supermarkets
American Express® Gold Card: Best for points
Chase Freedom Flex: Best for flexibility
Chase Freedom Unlimited: Best for everyday use
Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi: Best for groceries and gas
Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature: Best for Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh
Target REDCard: Best for groceries at Target
Amex EveryDay® Credit Card from American Express: Best for travel rewards with no annual fee Let's dive into the details of each of these cards and see how they compare to one another. Blue Cash Preferred from American Express: Best for cash back at US supermarkets If you spend more money at grocery stores than anywhere else, then the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express is the card for you. Although some other cards are currently offering increased bonuses on groceries for a limited time, this card will always give you a great return on your supermarket purchases 365 days a year. The Blue Cash Preferred offers 6% cash back at US supermarkets for up to $6,000 in purchases per year (then 1% cash back after that). There's no other card that offers this much cash back on groceries on an ongoing basis, so this is truly the best card when it comes to getting cash into your pocket.  Aside from the 6% cash back, the Blue Cash Preferred also offers a strong 6% cash back on select US streaming subscriptions. While being stuck at home, there's a good chance you've upped these subscription services, so this is one way to save some money in that department.  You'll also receive 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit with the Blue Cash Preferred. Although those are probably a smaller portion of your budget right now, when life gets back to normal, this is an ideal card to use on those categories as well. Keep in mind that the Blue Cash Preferred does carry a $95 annual fee, but right now for a limited time through Dec. 10, 2020, you can get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year. And even after that, if you're maxing out the 6% cash back at US supermarkets — $360 per year on $6,000 in purchases — then the annual fee pays for itself quite quickly. However, if your grocery expenses aren't that high, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead. The no-annual-fee Blue Cash Everyday earns 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1% cash back). That means if you spend less than about $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, you're better off with the Blue Cash Everyday instead of the Blue Cash Preferred. Is the Amex Blue Cash Preferred or Amex Blue Cash Everyday best for you?

American Express Gold Card: Best for points The American Express Gold Card is a top-notch card for groceries, as you'll not only get a relatively high return, but also some incredible baked-in benefits. It's not a cheap credit card with a $250 annual fee, but you might find that the perks outweigh the fee.  With the Amex Gold, you'll earn 4 points per dollar spent at US supermarkets (up to $25,000 per year in purchases, then 1x), 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide, 3 points per dollar spent for flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.  CNN Underscored's partner The Points Guy values Amex Membership Rewards points at 2 cents each. That means you're looking at an effective 8% return at US supermarkets, which is the highest total return you'll see for groceries on any credit card on an ongoing basis, even if other cards on our list are better for a limited time.  Aside from earning a lot of points, the Amex Gold also offers several annual statement credits. Right now, the easiest one to take advantage of is the up to $120 in dining credits. With this perk, you'll get up to $10 in statement credits each month when you use your card to pay at select merchants, including Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations. With both Grubhub and Seamless on this list, if you're ordering out regularly these days, you can easily use up these credits each month. And starting early next year, the Amex Gold will also come with $10 each month in Uber Cash, which can be used for either Uber rides or Uber Eats deliveries. Finally, while it's difficult to use at the moment, another money-saving benefit of the Amex Gold is its up to $100 in annual airline fee credits. These can be used on your airline of choice for incidental fees, such as checked bag fees and carry-on pet fees. These credits will be valuable once air travel starts up again, and since they're based on a calendar year, you can receive up to $100 in 2020 and then again in 2021, ultimately giving you up to $200 in airline credits in your first year of card membership.  Read CNN Underscored's review of the American Express Gold card.

Chase Freedom Flex: Best for flexibility If you have significant grocery expenses, the brand new Chase Freedom Flex credit card might be a great choice. That's because right now, new Freedom Flex card holders earn a whopping 5% cash back on grocery store purchases (not including Target or Walmart) in the first year you have the card, up to a maximum of $12,000 in spending. New card holders can also earn $200 in bonus cash back after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months after you open the account. And the Freedom Flex has a set of bonus categories that rotate each quarter, along with a trio of fixed bonus categories, so it's possible to earn even more cash back just by using the card in many of the places you normally shop. But if you want more value for your rewards, there's a way to get even more from this card. When you pair the Chase Freedom Flex with a premium Ultimate Rewards card — such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve — you can convert your cash back from the Freedom Flex into Chase Ultimate Rewards points at a ratio of 1 cent for 1 point, then transfer the points to your premium Chase card. Once you've converted your rewards to points, you can redeem them based on the options available on your premium card. That means you can use them at the Chase travel portal — where your points are worth between 1.25 cents apiece with the Chase Sapphire Preferred and 1.5 cents apiece with the Chase Sapphire Reserve — or with Chase's ""Pay Yourself Back"" tool, which lets you redeem points for purchases you've made in eligible categories, including grocery stores, dining establishments (including delivery and takeout) and home improvement stores. Learn more about the Chase Freedom Flex. Chase Freedom Unlimited: Best for everyday use The Chase Freedom Unlimited currently features the same sign-up bonus offer as its sister card, the Freedom Flex. That means new card applicants earn 5% cash back on grocery store purchases (not including Target or Walmart) in the first year you have the card, up to a maximum of $12,000 in spending, and can also earn $200 in bonus cash back after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months after you open the account.  But you'll also find this is a great card to have even when you're not grocery shopping. That's because the Chase Freedom Unlimited earns 1.5% cash back on all your purchases, and also now has three new permanent bonus categories: 5% cash back on travel purchases made via Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% cash back on dining — including takeout and delivery — and 3% cash back at drugstores. These new categories add a ton of value to an already very solid offering. Even better, if you want to earn points for travel down the road when borders reopen and planes get back in the air more broadly, you're already in good shape with the Chase Freedom Unlimited. That's because just like the Freedom Flex, you can pair this card with another premium Chase travel credit card such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred and redeem your rewards for travel at a higher value than if you just took the cash back. The one downside is that if you already have the Chase Freedom Unlimited, you now have the trio of new bonus categories but not the 5% cash back on grocery store purchases, as that's part of the card's sign-up bonus for new card holders only. Learn more about the Chase Freedom Unlimited. Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi: Best for groceries and gas If you like to buy in bulk — and save money along the way — there's a good chance that you're frequently at Costco. And if you drive regularly, you probably spend a lot of money on gas as well. People who fall into this bucket may find that the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi is a great option for both your grocery and gas needs. With this card, you'll earn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases (for the first $7,000 per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and costco.com. This is a no-annual fee card, but it does require you to have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.  You'll notice that the strong suit for this card is actually on gas purchases. Yes, you'll earn 2% cash back on groceries, but that only matches what you'd get on CNN Underscored's benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, which earns 1% cash back when you make a purchase, and another 1% cash back when you pay it off.  However, Costco only takes Visa cards at its stores, and since the Citi Double Cash is a Mastercard, it's not an option for your in-store Costco purchases (though you can use it at costco.com, which accepts credit cards other than Visa). Outside of your grocery purchases, purchase protection is anoth",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/cnn-underscored/best-credit-cards-for-groceries/index.html,CNN,_all

"The Electoral College, explained",2020-03-01,"Americans who go to the polls on Election Day don't actually select the President directly.  They are technically voting for 538 electors who, according to the system laid out by the Constitution, meet in their respective states and vote for President and Vice President. These people, the electors, comprise the Electoral College, and their votes are then counted by the President of the Senate in a joint session of Congress. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Why did the framers choose this system? There are a few reasons: First, they feared factions and worried that voters wouldn't make informed decisions. They didn't want to tell states how to conduct their elections. There were also many who feared that the states with the largest voting populations would essentially end up choosing the President. Others preferred the idea of Congress choosing the President, and there were proposals at the time for a national popular vote. The Electoral College was a compromise. The stain of slavery is on the Electoral College as it is on all US history. The formula for apportioning congressmen, which is directly tied to the number of electors, relied at that time on the 3/5 Compromise, whereby each slave in a state counted as fraction of a person to apportion congressional seats. This gave states in the South with many slaves more power despite the fact that large portions of their populations could not vote and were not free.  How it works There's an elector for every member of the House of Representatives (435) and Senate (100), plus an additional three for people who live in the District of Columbia.  Each state gets at least 3 electors. California, the most populous state, has 53 congressmen and two senators, so they get 55 electoral votes. Texas, the largest reliably Republican-leaning state, has 36 congressmen and two senators, so they get 38 electoral votes. Six states -- Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming -- are so small, population-wise, that they only have one congressperson apiece, and the lowest possible three electoral votes. The District of Columbia also gets three electoral votes. Voters in Puerto Rico and other non-state territories get no electoral votes, although they can take part in presidential primaries.  The states are in charge of selecting their own electors. And a number of states do not require their electors to honor the election results, which has led, occasionally, to the phenomenon known as a ""faithless elector."" It takes 270 electoral votes to get a majority of the Electoral College. The total number of electors -- 538 -- cannot change unless there are more lawmakers added on Capitol Hill or a constitutional amendment. But the number of electors allocated to each state can change every 10 years, after the constitutionally-mandated Census.  The number of congressmen is reapportioned -- that's the technical term -- according to changes in the population. Some states gain a House seat or two and others lose some. No state, no matter how small, can have zero members of Congress. But this is why there's been heated political debate over whether the US Census should ask if someone is a citizen. Some fear that asking it could make an accurate population count more difficult, or that states with many immigrants could end up with fewer lawmakers in elections starting in 2022, after the 2020 Census is complete. If there's a tie among the electors or if nobody gets a majority, then the election goes to the House of Representatives. Each state's delegation of lawmakers gets one vote and they choose between the top three electoral vote-getters. According to the 12th Amendment, if nobody gets a majority by a certain deadline, the Vice President becomes President. If there's no majority for the Vice President, the House delegations are excused and only the senators choose the Vice President. The 20th Amendment changed the deadline from March 4 to January 20.  Most states (except for Maine and Nebraska, which split some of their electoral votes) give all their electoral votes to the person who wins the popular vote in that state. There are very Democratic parts of Texas and very Republican parts of California, for instance. But unless those states move to apportion their electoral votes differently, it is only the state popular vote that really matters. Who likes this system? A popular vote system certainly would be simpler to understand.  However, as proponents of the Electoral College point out, if you thought that recount in Florida in 2000 was nasty, imagine a nationwide recount of more than 130 million votes. THAT would be messy. And it could happen. Some states have automatic recounts for elections that are separated by less than .1% In 2016, with 136 million voters, that would have been a margin of around 136,000 votes. You can imagine a recount in the razor-thin election of 1960, which featured a less-than .2% difference in vote totals, but a solid Electoral College victory for John F. Kennedy. One of the most important supporters is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has weighed in against the idea of a national popular vote effort on the Senate floor. Some defenses of the Electoral College have a racial tinge. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage said that without the Electoral College, white people will have less say, which is quite sad considering the 3/5 Compromise helped bring about the Electoral College in the first place. ""Actually what would happen if they do what they say they're gonna do is white people will not have anything to say,"" LePage said, according to reports. ""It's only going to be the minorities that would elect. It would be California, Texas, Florida. All the small states like Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming, Montana, Rhode Island, you'll never see a presidential candidate again. You'll never see anybody at the national stage come to our state,"" he said. ""We're gonna be forgotten people. It's an insane, insane process."" But 65 percent of Americans supported selecting the President by popular vote, compared to 32% who preferred the Electoral College in a June 2018 PRRI/Atlantic survey. There's less support if the wording includes changing the Constitution. A Pew survey in March of 2018 asked if Americans supported amending the Constitution to select the President by popular vote and a smaller 55%, still a popular majority, endorsed the idea. However, the Electoral College is written into the Constitution and changing the Constitution is very difficult. It takes years to accomplish and requires broad majorities in Congress or state legislatures. States that currently benefit from the Electoral College would have to give up some of that power. The other possibility is something like the aforementioned agreement by states to honor the national popular vote winner. But you can bet if that proposal takes hold, there will be lawsuits. That said, the Electoral College has actually changed three times, each by constitutional amendment. The 12th Amendment, passed after the tie election of 1800 (read about it!) made it so that electors voted for President and Vice President instead of voting for two people who could be President. The 20th Amendment put a time limit on the process. The 23rd Amendment gave electors to the District of Columbia. And there was a serious move decades ago to abolish the Electoral College altogether. In 1968, a proposal to replace the Electoral College with a popular vote system easily passed in the House. It was filibustered in the Senate.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/politics/what-is-electoral-college-history-explained/index.html,CNN,_all

The best nonstick pans of 2020,2020-04-17,"A quality nonstick pan is a true kitchen essential; from stir-fries to burgers to omelets, the stovetop staple basically does it all. Not all pans are created equal, however, and with thousands available in every possible price range, it can be tough to cull through marketing jargon to find the very best one.  So, to determine which nonstick pans were truly the best, we sorted through dozens of published reviews and perused user feedback to settle on 12 to put to the test. We cooked four different meals on every single contender, assessing nonstickiness (as in, could an egg really be flipped without oil or butter and leave no trace?), ergonomics, cleaning ease, temperature distribution and tolerance, durability and general aesthetics. After a lot of pancakes and too many eggs to count (yes, we know our job is tough), we were able to narrow our picks down to the three winners below.  The best nonstick pans Best Overall Pan: T-fal E76597 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan with Lid
Best Eco-Friendly Pan: GreenPan Levels Stackable Ceramic Fry Pan
Best Restaurant-Quality Pan: HexClad 10-Inch Hybrid Pan The short of it If you're a minimalist and prefer to have just a single pan in your kitchen, you'd be set with the T-fal E76597. This pan's depth gives it multipurpose functionality: It cooks standard frying-pan foods like eggs and meats, and its 2½-inch sides are tall enough to prepare recipes you'd usually reserve for pots, like rices and stews. It's a high-quality and affordable pan that outperformed some of the more expensive ones in our testing field. GreenPan's Ceramic Fry Pan boasts materials that'll please any chemical-conscious consumer. Unlike many nonstick pans, this one is free of materials that may pose long-term health risks, including PFAS, PFOA, lead and cadmium. The nonstick coating is, instead, made from sand, so it won't release any toxic fumes in the case of overheating.  The HexClad 10-Inch Hybrid Pan feels fancy (and yes, it's pricey as well), but it's also a sturdy piece of cookware that blew the competition out of the kitchen during every one of our tests: Food slid off easily, it was a breeze to clean, and heat was evenly distributed while cooking. If you're looking for a pro-level upgrade to your cookware, this is everything you want in a nonstick pan wrapped in a pretty package.  The long of it Best Overall Pan: T-fal E76597 Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan with Lid ($39.99, originally $55.95; amazon.com) Why we love it in a sentence: Whether you're looking to steam a mountain of veggies or sear a steak, this affordable option can handle it all with ease.  This pan is a steal. At just under $45 (with lid included), it can cook way more than the average frying pan, with the ability to boil and stew. Its extended side height helps contain voluminous veggies — like kale — that would otherwise overflow before they're wilted down by heat.  When it comes to pulling off nonstick, the T-fal absolutely delivers. Nothing clings to the pan's surface, which is made with anodized aluminum, a golden term in the nonstick world but one you might not be familiar with. Anodizing and aluminum go together like peanut butter and jelly; the electrochemical process converts the metal into a more durable, corrosion-resistant material, according to the Aluminum Anodizing Council. Rather than strengthening the pan's surface layer like a coating would, aluminum that is anodized is integrated, so it can't peel off or chip.  The T-fal model can withstand up to 400 degrees in the oven (though the lid can handle up to 350 degrees before some of the parts get compromised) and comes with a lifetime warranty. Indeed, the pan came out of a 400-degree oven looking exactly like it went in. And even then, the saucy dish we'd cooked up required no pressure to remove. The center of the pan is marked with a red ""thermo spot indicator"" that turns solid red when the pan is properly preheated, which does work, but feels a little gimmicky unless you're particularly passionate about preheating. The handle is made of silicone and is comfortable, light to grip and, most importantly, stays relatively cool when heated. It's also punctured with a sizable hole, making it possible to hang vertically — a storage bonus for tiny kitchens.  The pan is marketed as ""2x more scratch resistant,"" and while that is a pretty vague claim, it boldly stood up to our scratch tests. We gave this thing a real beating with metal utensils, but the pan showed absolutely no evidence of this. (Still, the manufacturers recommend using metal utensils with care.) The material is nontoxic, so even if you were to overheat or scratch the pan, you wouldn't have to worry about it leaching into your food.  When it comes to cleaning up, T-fal gives no trouble at all. Soap, water and a sponge make the perfect team. For less than the cost of a quality restaurant meal, this is the nonstick pan that does it all — and then some. A perfect frying pan is hard to come by, and yet the T-fal makes the title seem effortless. We can't imagine finding anything better. In fact, after our testing, the T-fal tied in terms of overall score with the pro-level HexClad that sells for more than double the price. Best Eco-Friendly Pan: GreenPan Levels Stackable Ceramic Frypan ($139.99 for a set of two; macys.com) Why we love it in a sentence: True to its name, the GreenPan is a healthier, environmentally friendly nonstick pan that actually works.  Ceramic cookware has become popular in the wellness world; it has a reputation of being ""healthier"" than those made from Teflon or copper. Ceramic has a benefit — especially when cooking at high temperatures — because there are no possible chemicals that can leach into foods. GreenPan didn't win our vote just for these reasons (though they are a bonus); it's simply a really great pan.  Eggs, pancakes and even a sticky peanut sauce glided across the surface like they were Kristi Yamaguchi. After cooking, close to zero residue remained on the pan, which led to a very speedy cleanup consisting of wiping, rinsing and going on with our business.  This pan was a real ergonomic delight. At 2 pounds, it is the lightest of our top three picks, making it easy on the wrist and easy to move, whether you're transferring food from pan to plate or adding some elbow grease into your sauté. Unlike the other two pans, aesthetically, GreenPan looks basic; without a distinguishing surface pattern, it could be easily mistaken for any ordinary pan, which is part of its charm.  Like the T-fal, this pan boasts an anodized aluminum body, which can be credited for the even cooking and temperature distribution. It's also incredibly scratch-resistant: Dragging a metal fork across its surface revealed the same marks as running a finger along it — which is to say, none. The pan can tolerate up to 400 degrees in the oven, and its silicone-wrapped handle helps keep it cool to the touch. The Thermolon ceramic nonstick surface, which is derived from sand rather than any kind of toxic materials, thrives at lower heat settings but won't release chemical fumes if you cook it on high. On its website, GreenPan claims that 60% less CO2 is emitted during Thermolon's coating process compared with the CO2 emitted during the process of traditional coatings, which we suppose is what puts the ""green"" in its name.  And Goop fans, you're in luck. Even Gwyneth Paltrow is on board with this pick; she's partnered with GreenPan and sells a bevy of ceramic, more Instagrammable offerings through her wellness brand.  Best Restaurant-Quality Pan: HexClad 10-Inch Hybrid Frying Pan ($109.99, originally $131; hexclad.com) Why we love it in a sentence: While you're paying a premium, you're getting a tough-as-nails pan you'd find in professional kitchens: Nothing you cook will stick, it wards off scratches, it can withstand the highest oven temps out of the bunch we tested, and it looks stunning.  Ooh la la. If anything, displaying this pan atop your stove will make guests believe you know what you're doing in the kitchen.  While significantly more expensive than the other pans on our list, the HexClad stands out from the rest for its build quality. It has a black hexagon top layer pattern, designed to create a series of ""peaks and valleys."" According to the manufacturers, the valleys are what give the pan its nonstick properties, while the stainless steel peaks provide the even heating while protecting the pan from flaking or peeling. To us, the design looks cool and makes for a smooth cleaning and cooking surface. The pan's unique surface texture does seem to ward off scratches from any foul play — a sharp knife, a menacing fork, and even a metal spatula were no match for the durable pan. (The company CEO even made a very convincing video in which he runs a metal pizza cutter and a motorized hand mixer across the pan without any damage.) Those nooks and crannies also seemed to distribute heat well, as food cooked evenly no matter which side of the pan it was on. The makers suggest seasoning the pan first, which we did: As directed, we heated up a bit of oil for a couple of minutes and then washed it away. And then, we made a cheesy omelette and devoured every last remnant, since not a single strand of cheese or egg was left behind stuck on the pan. And the same can be said for cooking fish, whipping up pancakes and creating saucy concoctions. Nothing seemed to stick, and cleanup was a breeze.  Another thing this pan has over all the others: It's the most heat-durable of our three picks, maxing out at 500 degrees in the oven. That means you can throw it in the oven for hours without worrying about it warping. It's dubbed a hybrid for its stainless steel and nonstick combination, which provides it with a high-quality appearance and will make the piece last. (HexClad is backed with a lifetime warranty, though, just in case.) Stainless steel on its own isn't a great heat conductor, but this model is built with an aluminum middle layer that perfectly distributes heat for a uniform cooking temp.    Unlike many of the other stainless pans we tried, the bottom of the HexClad didn't burn or change colors when it was overheated, thanks to the black nonstick design that appears here, too. This is a really nice feature for cleaning; if any of your food spills or overflows, a simple scrub will do. Even melted plastic came off the bottom with a simple swipe with the sponge. Best practices for nonstick pans Over the course of testing four different meals on a dozen different pans, we learned some things about nonstick pans that (perhaps naively) we hadn't known before. Most quality nonstick frying pans, it turns out, work best on medium-low heat. Make the stovetop too hot and you can burn yourself, overcook your food (rubbery eggs are not good eggs) and wear down the pan's nonstick properties faster, according to ma",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/cnn-underscored/best-nonstick-pans/index.html,CNN,_all

Are you using the best credit card when ordering food for delivery?,2020-04-09,"CNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through The Points Guy affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective. While restaurants are now open in most places around the country, people are still relying on food delivery services more than ever. Services like Seamless, Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats allow folks to order from their favorite restaurants but have the food delivered to their door instead of venturing outside. But which credit card should you use when you order food for delivery? We've rounded up the best credit cards for food delivery services, while paying close attention to cards that also include strong earnings for dine-in options, so that regardless of whether you're eating in or dining out, you'll have the best of both worlds. The best credit cards for food delivery Chase Freedom Flex: Best for delivery and dining
American Express® Gold Card: Best for Seamless and Grubhub
Chase Sapphire Reserve: Best for DoorDash
Chase Sapphire Preferred Card: Best cheaper alternative for DoorDash
The Platinum Card® from American Express: Best for Uber Eats
Capital One® Savor® Cash Rewards Credit Card: Best for dining and groceries
American Express® Green Card: Best for flexible travel rewards Why did we select these cards as our best credit cards for food delivery? Dive into the details of each card with us, and see how they stack up. Chase Freedom Flex Best for delivery and dining The no-annual-fee Chase Freedom Flex is a brand-new credit card that earns 3% cash back on all dining purchases, including eligible food delivery services. That means you'll earn 3% cash back when you order food for delivery as well as when you go out to eat. But dining isn't the only bonus category on the Freedom Flex card. You'll also earn 3% cash back at drugstores, 5% cash back on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards and 5% cash back on a set of categories that rotate every three months, up to $1,500 in combined purchases each quarter. Plus, if your income has dropped this year and you need help making ends meet, the Chase Freedom Flex offers 0% interest on all purchases for the first 15 months you have the card (then a variable 14.99% to 23.74% afterward). That introductory offer enables you to make here-and-now purchases and pay them off over a longer period of time, saving big bucks on interest.  The cherry on top is that the Freedom Flex currently comes with a very sweet sign-up bonus. You'll earn a one-time $200 cash bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within the first three months after you open the account, plus new card holders earn 5% cash back on grocery purchases (not including Target and Walmart) for the first 12 months you have the card, up to $12,000 in combined purchases. Oh, and did we mention there's no annual fee on the Freedom Flex card? (There isn't.) Learn more about the Chase Freedom Flex. American Express Gold Best for Seamless and Grubhub Amex redesigned its Amex Gold card last year to cater to both eating in and dining out, offering 4 points for every dollar you spend at supermarkets in the United States up to $25,000 per year (1x thereafter), and an unlimited 4 points per dollar at eateries worldwide. Most food delivery services will code as ""restaurants"" on the Amex Gold card, meaning you'll earn 4 points per dollar for those purchases. You'll also enjoy up to $120 in annual dining credits — which are broken up into $10 statement credits each month — when you pay with the Amex Gold at food delivery services Grubhub and Seamless, along with purchases at The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations. The Amex Gold's 35,000-point welcome bonus — available after you spend $4,000 on purchases in your first three months of card membership — isn't spectacular, but those Amex Membership Rewards points are worth at least $350 when you redeem them via Amex Travel for airfare, and you can potentially get even more value than that with Amex's transfer partners. Read CNN Underscored's review of the American Express Gold card.

It earns 3 points per dollar on all forms of dining globally, but it also provides up to $60 in annual DoorDash credits in both 2020 and 2021. This credit is incredibly easy to use — just charge your DoorDash order to your Sapphire Reserve, and you'll get a statement credit offsetting the charge, up to $60 this year alone. You also don't have to use the entire $60 in one fell swoop -— you can use it across several separate orders over time. But before you place that DoorDash order, make sure you also take advantage of another Chase Sapphire Reserve perk — up to two years of free DashPass membership. DashPass is a program that offers free delivery from eligible DoorDash restaurants, and you can get it at no cost just by adding your Sapphire Reserve as the default payment method in the DoorDash app, and then activating your DashPass membership. The Chase Sapphire Reserve is an expensive card, but it somewhat softens the blow of its $550 annual fee with a $300 annual travel credit that covers any travel at all — parking lots, garages, and ride-sharing included — charged to the card. However, if you're looking for a cheaper alternative that earns the same type of points, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card (below) is worth considering instead. Learn more about the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Chase Sapphire Preferred Best cheaper alternative for DoorDash The less-expensive version of the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 2 points per dollar on all travel and dining purchases, 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides and an increased 80,000-point sign-up bonus after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account — all for a reasonable $95 annual fee.  Related: Chase Sapphire Preferred vs. Chase Sapphire Reserve: Which is best for you? Another key benefit? Discounts on DoorDash food delivery orders via a complimentary DashPass membership, valid through at least Dec. 31, 2021, and a comprehensive suite of purchase and travel protections. Plus most food delivery purchases code as ""dining"" on the Sapphire Preferred, so you'll earn double points when you have food delivered. The points you earn with the Chase Sapphire Preferred can be redeemed for travel through Chase's Ultimate Rewards travel portal or by using the card's ""Pay Yourself Back"" tool at a rate of 1.25 cents per point, so you're guaranteed at least $1,000 in travel right off the bat from the sign-up bonus, and potentially much more if you take some time and effort to maximize Chase's 13 airline and hotel partners. The Chase Sapphire Preferred doesn't offer the same luxury travel perks — like airline lounge access and travel credits — as the Chase Sapphire Reserve. However, the $95 annual fee is significantly lower, and possibly a better choice right now given the current restrictions on travel. Read CNN Underscored's review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred.

It comes with up to $200 in annual Uber Cash credits — which are spread across all 12 months of the year at $15 a pop, plus an extra $20 in December — and you can use those credits on Uber Eats orders as well as Uber trips. Because the Amex Platinum is an ultra-luxury travel card, that's actually just the start of its benefits. You'll also get up to $200 in airline fee credits, up to $100 in Saks Fifth Avenue credits, access to the American Express Centurion Lounges, access to Delta Sky Clubs (when flying Delta), access to Priority Pass lounges around the world (though not restaurants), Gold elite status at Marriott and Hilton and up to a $100 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credit. But let's be frank: The Amex Platinum isn't a cheap credit card. At $550 a year, you'll need to be able to take advantage of all its perks to make it worth the investment, and that's not easy to do right now with travel at an ebb due to the pandemic. However, because of that, the Amex Platinum currently has some additional limited-time perks.  Now through December 31, with the Amex Platinum, you'll get up to $20 in monthly credits for wireless telephone services purchased directly from U.S. service providers, and up to $20 a month in credits for select U.S. streaming services. That's up to $120 in combined credits if you get the card now and can take advantage of them all for the next three months, which definitely helps offset the hefty annual fee. Finally, you'll earn a welcome bonus of 60,000 points after you spend $5,000 in purchases on the Amex Platinum within the first three months after opening the account. That's easily enough to get you a pair of round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the country once travel resumes more broadly.

Capital One Savor Rewards Card Best for dining and groceries The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Card costs $95 per year, though the annual fee is waived for the first year. However, it earns 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, and given that food delivery services typically code as ""dining,"" that's an exceptional return. There's also 2% cash back at grocery stores on the Capital One Savor and 1% on all other purchases. If you order groceries directly from the grocery store for delivery, you should earn the 2% cash back, though grocery delivery services themselves such as Amazon Fresh may code differently and not earn bonus cash back. Related: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards. Keep in mind that if you're getting a new credit card, the Chase Freedom Flex offers a higher 5% cash back on groceries for the first year you have the card, up to $12,000 in purchases, and it has no annual fee. So while the Capital One Savor is better for groceries on an ongoing basis, the Freedom Flex earns more in year one. With the Capital One Savor, you'll also earn a one-time $300 cash bonus once you spend $3,000 on purchases within three months from account opening. There are no foreign transaction fees, and the card includes perks such as extended warranty protection, travel accident insurance and complimentary concierge service.  If you're willing to pay an annual fee to earn a bit more in cash back on your food delivery purchases, the Capital One Savor card could make sense",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/cnn-underscored/best-food-delivery-credit-cards/index.html,CNN,_all
"Blueland's nontoxic cleaners can save money, space and even the planet",2020-02-27,"When Sarah Paiji Yoo became a mom, she started to take a closer look at the quality of the water her son would be drinking. She was shocked to learn that microplastics — tiny particles of plastic — are everywhere, from our food to our oceans. Yoo vowed to reduce her plastic use, but found her options were limited when it came to cleaning supplies.   ""I decided to cut back on my plastic consumption, but realized I didn't have much choice as a consumer to cut out single-use plastic packaging for household products,"" Yoo told CNN Underscored. ""So many of our everyday products come packaged in just one way — single-use plastic."" To help solve this problem, Yoo, who had experience with startups, founded Blueland, a company that aims to reduce the number of single-use plastic containers we use every day. Blueland's nontoxic and planet-friendly cleaners and hand soap are created in reusable ""Forever Bottles."" To make each product, you add water to the reusable bottle and drop in a tablet of concentrated cleaning ingredients.  While each of the products can be purchased individually, they're also sold together in a starter pack at a 20% discount, Blueland's The Clean Essentials, for $39.  Blueland: The Clean Essentials ($39; blueland.com)      The Clean Essentials includes four reusable bottles and wrapped tablets to create a foaming hand soap and three cleaners (glass and mirror, multisurface and bathroom). One tablet, dissolved in water, creates 9 ounces of hand soap or 20 ounces of cleaning solution. Replacement tablets can be purchased in packs starting at $6 for 3 tablets.   Blueland's planet-friendly products  Blueland's name stems from its environmental mission. ""The name 'Blueland' embodies our mission to return oceans to their natural, pristine state and encompasses the notion that our home does not stop at our doorstep,"" says Yoo. In addition to the company's goal of reducing single-use plastic containers, Blueland cleaners and hand wash are nontoxic. All the products are certified by the environmental group Cradle to Cradle, the anti-cruelty organization Leaping Bunny and USDA Biobased Preferred. ""It was really important for us, from the very beginning (actually since the idea stage) to partner with Cradle to Cradle because it is the world's most comprehensive product assessment and certification program,"" Yoo explains.  Blueland's ingredients are all on the EPA Safer Chemicals Ingredients List, and none is on the Environmental Working Group Restricted List. ""We are huge philosophical supporters of the EPA Safer Choice standards, which is why we adopted the program's criteria as core to our product development,"" Yoo adds. ""With Safer Choice, each ingredient, regardless of its percentage in a product, must meet strict safety criteria for both human and environmental health including, but not limited to, carcinogenicity, reproductive and development toxicity, toxicity to aquatic life and persistence in the environment.""  Blueland's products are also hypoallergenic, vegan, cruelty-free, non-GMO, Prop 65-compliant and gluten-free. What's more, the carbon footprint involved in shipping Blueland refill tablets is a fraction of that of a standard single-use plastic container of cleaner or hand soap, which was enough for us to want to check out and review the products ourselves.   Blueland Hand Soap Starter Set  ($16; blueland.com) Blueland's foaming hand soap can be purchased as part of The Clean Essentials Kit or individually. The Blueland Hand Soap Starter Kit includes the reusable glass bottle as well as one tablet in each of the three scents: the original Iris Agave, Lemon Perrine, and Lavender Eucalyptus.  The glass soap bottle has a modern look and a satisfying heft — it doesn't shift when you push down the lever, as plastic hand soap containers sometimes do when the contents are getting low. As with all Blueland products, the hand soap is prepared by filling the glass bottle with warm water to a line marked on the bottle and dropping in a tablet. The process, which looks like an antacid dissolving in water, takes about 30 minutes, and the instructions say there's no shaking required.  Blueland's hand soap worked well and wasn't drying. The three scents are light and not cloying: both the iris and lemon have a lovely fresh scent, and the lavender is the strongest of the three. All of the Blueland products have undergone independent third-party testing to ensure that they're as effective as leading comparable brands, according to the company. And in addition to being compliant with Blueland's nontoxic certifications, the hand soap is free of parabens, phthalates and sodium lauryl sulfate.  The Blueland system is also designed to be cost-effective. Yoo estimates that most families use about 25 bottles of hand soap per year. With the Blueland system, you would use the same number of tablets, with each refill costing $2 (or less if you buy in packs of six or nine), so it's less expensive than most comparable foaming soaps after the first few uses. What's more, keeping refills at the ready requires a tiny fraction of the shelf space. ""Blueland is dedicated to making it easy for people to make the right choice with products that are more effective, affordable and convenient, underscoring my belief that you don't have to sacrifice a clean home for a clean planet,"" Yoo says.  Hand Soap Refill Packs, 3-Pack (starting at $6; blueland.com)   While the Blueland Hand Soap bottle is recommended for use with the hand soap tablets, it's not required. Hand soap tablets can also be purchased individually in packs of three, six, or nine and dissolved in 9 ounces of water in any reusable foaming soap container. For families concerned about using a glass soap bottle with small kids, the hand soap tablets can be used in a reusable plastic container. We tried a set of three BPA-free dispensers, available on Amazon ($13.99; amazon.com), that worked well.  _______________________________________________________________________ The Clean Up Kit ($29; blueland.com)  Blueland offers three cleaners: Glass and Mirror (blue), Multi-Surface (yellow), and Bathroom (pink). Each is created by filling the reusable ""Forever Bottle"" with warm water and allowing the corresponding tablet to dissolve.  The cleaners are sold as part of The Clean Essentials Kit ($39; blueland.com), together in The Clean Up Kit ($29 for three bottles and three tablets; blueland.com) or individually ($16 for one bottle and three tablets; blueland.com). The spray ""Forever Bottles,"" as their name suggests, are designed to be reused and are made from nonleaching and shatter-proof BPA-free plastic. Refill tablets, like the hand soap, start at three for $6.  The unscented blue glass and mirror cleaner left windows shiny and streak-free. The lemon-scented multisurface cleaner (which works on tile, wood, counters and stone) worked well against grease on kitchen counters and dust on wood furniture. And the eucalyptus and mint-scented bathroom cleaner cut through grime on a bathroom sink and toilet.  If the products fall short anywhere, it's perhaps the bathroom and multisurface cleaners' ability to disinfect. Whereas a competitive eco-friendly brand touts its ability to kill 99% of germs, the Blueland cleaners are not guaranteed to do so.  ""We cannot definitively say that our cleaners will kill bacteria, but our cleaner will actually wash away the bacteria,"" explains Yoo. ""An example I like to use is dish soap is typically not anti-bacterial, but does actually wash away bacteria, but will not kill it on contact. We trust dish soap to clean dishes and pans that have even touched raw meat and eggs."" So while the products are excellent everyday cleaners, you might want to opt for something stronger if you're, say, trying to disinfect the bathroom after everyone in your family has succumbed to the stomach bug.  The bottom line We loved the Blueland products: They help save money, space and, most importantly, the planet. The hand soap is a winner, and we may never go back to single-use plastic containers of hand soap. The cleaners do a great job for everyday cleaning, particularly the Glass and Mirror Cleaner. The only possible shortcoming is the question of whether the Multi-Surface Cleaner and the Bathroom Cleaner disinfect surfaces if you need them to. Other than that, we're ordering refill tablets right now. Blueland: The Clean Essentials ($39; blueland.com)   ",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/cnn-underscored/blueland-review/index.html,CNN,_all

How Thomas Partey risked everything to follow European football dream,2020-02-17,"It's a story of flight and resilience to become a professional footballer in one of European football's top leagues. Of having to work three times as hard as other players because you're ""African."" And having succeeded in fulfilling that ambition not forgetting about those who have made that journey from Africa in search of a similar dream. When the call did come to leave Ghana for Spain, an 18-year-old Thomas Partey knew he couldn't tell anybody -- not even his parents. As the now Atletico Madrid midfielder prepares for Tuesday's Champions League last-16 first leg against Liverpool, Partey tells CNN Sport that no one else could know what was going down as his club Tema Youth would demand a transfer fee even though they were not officially entitled to one. ""I was playing in a second division team in Ghana,"" Thomas says at Atletico's training ground in suburban Madrid. ""I was not registered, I just played and got my winning bonus. ""So when I got the chance to travel to Spain I didn't want to tell anybody, not even my parents, as maybe they'd be asked where I'd gone and they'd tell. I only spoke with my agent, who did everything for me. Then I traveled to Spain."" READ: Robert Lewandowski equals Gerd Muller's Bundesliga record and eyes even more history Big gamble Thomas was willing to risk everything as his dream since being born in the southern Ghanaian town of Odumase Krobo in 1993 had been to follow his father by playing professionally. ""When I was young my father used to play,"" he says. ""He always took me to the training ground. So from the beginning, a very young age, all I wanted to do was play football. ""But then it got to a stage that I have to study, it was not easy, my father had no job, so I had to work, and afterwards go and find a place to play with my friends."" Things became more serious when he moved away from his family to the city of Ashaiman, to play first for Revelation FC, then Tema Youth, in Ghana's second division. ""It was very difficult,"" Thomas remembers. ""I was just 10 years old and moving to a very dangerous city in Ghana. For my mother it was like losing her son. But the managers spoke to my parents and I wanted to be there. All I wanted to do was to continue playing football."" But the ambition was always to come to Europe, and in summer 2011 Spanish agent Jose Jimenez organized a trial at Atletico. Nothing was sure -- it was a big gamble without any official offer.  ""I just came to trials, normally my agent brings players to Europe, to different clubs,"" Thomas says. ""I came directly to Atletico Madrid. From the beginning it was not easy. ""Waking up early in the morning, with the cold, the language, the people, to understand how to play their football and everything. But then I told myself that this is where I want to be, and I need to work hard every day to get to where I want to be, to the first team. After two months they gave me the chance to stay."" Thomas knows that hundreds of other African players have less fortunate European experiences each year, and is still represented by Jimenez, who has guided his career to date. ""Most agents are only here to get their money and then leave you,"" he says. ""They don't care about you. But I'm happy I had the best agent, who cared for me. I put my trust in him, and tried to be patient."" READ: Manchester City banned from upcoming UEFA competitions 'Work harder' Atletico's long-serving coach Diego Simeone was another big influence, Thomas says. ""From the beginning it was not easy. [Simeone] helped me a lot. He knew I had the talent, but without my head functioning well I would not be able to get to where I am now."" By 2012, Thomas was starting for Atletico's B team in Spain's third tier. He then spent seasons on loan at Real Mallorca in the Segunda Division and Almeria in Primera, before returning as an Atletico first team player from 2015. He maintains that it is more difficult for young Africans to succeed at European clubs. ""The most important is to have the talent,"" he says. ""But then there is already a European in your position. You have to work harder than them, double or triple as hard. That's the only way for African players to be successful in Europe."" Racism remains a major problem in Spanish football, seen most recently with Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams suffering abuse during a LaLiga game at Espanyol in late January. ""It happens, but I just try to be myself, always, not to listen to them, and enjoy my game,"" Thomas explains. ""When you try and control it, it will come back. I'm there to play. As long as you don't give your mind to them, it will never affect you."" READ: Manchester City to face Real Madrid in Champions League Thomas' experiences motivated him to buy a share in Madrid semi-professional regional division club Alcobendas Sport last summer. ""We got the team to be able to give a chance to a lot of African players to prove themselves,"" Thomas says, with youngsters from Ghana, Ivory Coast and Guinea having already been signed. ""We got a European coach [ex-LaLiga player Alfredo Santaelena, who was a youth coach at Atletico during Thomas' early years there] to teach them the style of play which will help them play at better teams."" More a doer than a talker, Thomas has earned respect from his teammates in the Atletico dressing room through his commitment and displays on the pitch. Such maturity is also evident from how the quietly spoken 26-year-old, without the eye-catching tattoos or loud jewelery of some of his peers, talks openly and earnestly to CNN even with the interview coming the day after his team's humiliating Copa del Rey defeat at third-tier La Cultural Leonesa. READ: Cristiano Ronaldo continues 2020 goal glut This season has seen Thomas play a deeper midfield role for Atletico, using his reading of the game and range of passing to break up opposition moves and start his own team's attacks. A standout performance was in September when he outplayed Real Madrid's Toni Kroos and Luka Modric during a 0-0 La Liga derby draw at the Wanda Metropolitano. ""Thomas has been with us five or six years and I'm very happy he is being recognised now for both his hard work and talent,"" Simeone said following that game. ""If he had been signed from an English or German club it would be different, but he is from your youth system, so he is 'just Thomas.' His work does not stop now. He has a big future ahead of him."" Recent months have however been tough for the team, with January bringing painful exits from both the Spanish Supercopa and Copa, while Atletico also fell well behind Real Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga.  READ: What now for Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's European ban? Los Rojiblancos are now big outsiders against last year's Champions League winners and this year's runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool. ""We know it's not going to be easy,"" says Partey. ""But every team who gets to the last 16 is one of the best teams in Europe. We're used to difficult situations. ""We'll do our homework and I'm sure we'll be at the level we're supposed to be. We don't think of the end, we focus on now, and build our confidence until we can achieve what we are going to achieve."" READ: Liverpool beat Tottenham in Champions League final Matching Liverpool will be a huge challenge, but positivity and ambition have already helped Thomas overcome huge odds to make a success of his career at Atletico. For the boy who left Ghana in secret to pursue his dream, anything seems possible.

When you make a purchase, CNN receives revenue. CNN news staff is not involved at all in the selections or product reviews. For more on what we do and how we do it, visit our About Us page. Before the age of DSLR cameras and Instagram, when people wanted to capture and display their cherished memories, they'd do so using brushes and paint. And with the ease, accessibility and sheer abundance of digital prints out there (from holiday cards and wedding photos, to photo albums, customized fridge magnets and everything in between), it's time to revisit those good old days.  Paint Your Life connects real artists to customers, making the process of creating a unique, handcrafted portrait easier than ever. And since its inception in 2006, thousands of customers have received a unique painting of their own; the company has a nearly perfect 4.9-star rating from over 5,000 customers.   Hand-painted portraits can add texture to your gallery wall, give a room a unique touch and honor an important figure in your life. Plus, they're a great gift for family and friends. And unlike the olden days of portrait painting, where you'd be required to sit very, very still for hours on end, today's portrait-making process is as simple as sending a photo to the artist of your choice and waiting for your final creation to be delivered to your doorstep.  For the uninitiated, here's a breakdown of Paint Your Life's services.  What is Paint Your Life?  Paint Your Life is a portrait service that takes your photographic memories and turns them into stunning, handmade oil paintings that you can hang in your home. Each painting is hand crafted by a professional studio painter (you can see the full roster and portfolios of current artists here), who can recreate your family photos in different mediums, including charcoal, watercolor, pencil, pastel and acrylic paints. Customers have memorialized a variety of snaps, including pictures of their weddings, furry friends, favorite landscapes, family members and even themselves.  How does the service work?  Customers choose the size of their painting (options start at 8 inches by 10 inches and can be as large as 48 inches by 72 inches), the subject of the portrait and the medium. They then upload the photo of their choice to the site, and the Paint Your Life artists get to work.  Unlike other services, customers have full say in the creation process from beginning to end. You can even compile your portraits. For those who need photos restored, Paint Your Life will do so before starting the order, and if you want to bring vibrancy to a black and white picture, Paint Your Life will also create the portrait in color. Both services are free.  Online proofs are uploaded to the site, allowing users to see the painting and give feedback or request alterations throughout the process. And even before the painting reaches your hands, the artwork is appraised by other artists to ensure its quality.  Prices for Paint Your Life start at $179, and the turnaround time ranges from 14 to 21 days. Plus, when you use the promo code CNN60, you'll get $60 off your purchase and free international shipping through January 2021."" from the content as soon as you can? What other benefits are there to Paint Your Life?  On top of all of the aforementioned services, Paint Your Life boasts an unlimited amount of revisions while your work is being created, free shipping and a 100% money back guarantee if you aren't thrilled with the final product.  What are customers saying?  Uniqueness aside, what has truly impressed us about Paint Your Life are the company's stellar reviews. On TrustPilot alone, it has a 4.9-star rating from over 3,000 customers.  Many of the ratings spotlight the company's helpful review process. As one past reviewer writes, ""As always I was skeptical, but they [Paint Your Life] give you complete autonomy at every step of the process, including the finished painting. The results surpassed my expectations!"" Another customer writes, ""I absolutely love my painting! The artist was able to capture the personality and essence of my dog in such a remarkable way. I also appreciated being kept informed every step of the way.""  Other honorable mentions from customers include the overall craftsmanship and framing options Paint Your Life provides, and many reviewers have noted that they have used the service more than once.   Our verdict Considering the level of customer service and craftsmanship you receive with each Paint Your Life Portrait, we're completely sold on the service. Moreover, we think it makes for one of the most memorable presents you can give.  With the holidays right around the corner, ordering a Paint Your Life creation now means that it will be delivered and ready to be wrapped before Christmas. Talk about good timing.

Last chance to get up to 40% off at Amazon with targeted American Express cards,2020-04-03,"CNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through The Points Guy affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective. Many American Express cards earn Membership Rewards points that are generally best used for amazing travel opportunities. But another lesser-known use for these points is to redeem them for purchases at Amazon, and the online retailer is currently offering not one, but two terrific promotions that allow you to save money by using your Amex points. But there's only a few days left to take advantage of the best of these offers, so if you have an Amex card, you'll need to move quickly to save money when shopping at Amazon right now.  Only certain American Express cards are eligible for these promotions, so scoring them can be a little complicated. But we're going to take you through it step by step to make sure you're getting as much of a discount as possible when you're shopping at Amazon.  Save up to 40%, or as much as $10 off $50 at Amazon Let's start with the broad details of these two promotions. If you're targeted for the first offer, you can get up to 40% off your Amazon purchases when you use at least one Amex point to pay. While this is a single promotion, there are two variations. Most eligible recipients will see a 30% discount, capped at a $30 savings. But there are some lucky people who will score a whopping 40% discount, capped at a $50 savings. This ongoing offer is currently set to end on September 30. So if you're targeted, you'll want to make sure you take advantage of it between now and then.  But if you're not eligible for either of those discounts, a second promotion is also available. Similar to the first offer, there are two different variations of this promotion. If you're targeted, you can save either $5 off a $30 purchase or $10 off a $50 purchase at Amazon. You'll see which offer you're eligible for, if either, when activating the offer. This second promotion doesn't expire until December 31, which means you'll have the rest of 2020 to reap your savings. So even if you don't have any Amazon shopping on your radar at the moment, you should be able to apply the offer to a future purchase down the line. How to save money at Amazon with your American Express card How can you get these Amazon discounts? To start, you must have an American Express card that earns Membership Rewards points. Amex cards that earn other types of rewards, such as cash back or airline miles, won't work. But there are plenty of Amex cards that earn Membership Rewards points — a small sampling of them is at the end of this story. Next, you'll need to link your Amazon and American Express accounts. Add your American Express card as a payment method in your Amazon account, if you haven't already. Then look for the option to enroll in ""Shop with Points"" under the ""Your Account"" tab, and click the ""Enroll"" button for the Amex card you just added. Once your accounts are connected, you'll need to activate each offer. Click on this link for the up-to-40%-off offer, and click on this link for the $5-off-$30 or $10-off-$50 offer.  Remember, these are targeted promotions, so not everyone will be eligible for them — you could be targeted for one of the offers, both or neither. When you click on the links, if you see a message that you're not eligible, then you're unfortunately not targeted for that particular promotion. (Though if you just enrolled in ""Shop with Points,"" you may need to wait 24 hours for Amazon's records to refresh before knowing if you're targeted, so check back in a day or two.) However, if you're eligible, then activate the offer by clicking on the ""Activate now"" button — the enrollment page will indicate your particular discount. You can then shop at Amazon as you normally would, though only products sold and shipped by Amazon are eligible for these discounts. Additionally, Amazon gift cards are excluded, though other third-party gift cards sold by Amazon are eligible. But wait! There's one more step. When you're ready to check out, you'll want to make sure to select your linked American Express card as your payment method. Then you'll need to use at least 1 point to pay for your purchase for the discount to apply. When paying with Amex Membership Rewards points at Amazon, 1 point equals 0.7 cents. That's not the best value you can get for Amex points. CNN Underscored's partner The Points Guy values Membership Rewards points as high as 2 cents each when redeemed for travel.  However, it's important to note that you don't have to pay for your entire Amazon purchase with points to get either of these discounts. In fact, you can use just 1 point and pay for the rest with your Amex card, and you'll still see the discount applied to your order.  To pay with the minimum number of points required, enter $0.01 in the points section, which will apply just 1 point to your payment, You can use any number of points you want, but if you don't make this change, Amazon may automatically apply the maximum number of points to cover the entire purchase, so you'll want to make sure to update the amount before you place the order. Once you've applied at least 1 point to your payment, you'll see the discount added to your order. For the 30% and 40% offers, the discount will apply to every order you place between now and September 30 until you hit a total of $30 in maximum savings on the 30% offer, or the $50 maximum on the 40% offer. For the $5- and $10-off offers, you'll need to spend a minimum of $30 or $50 in a single transaction — depending on which offer you're targeted for — between now and December 31 to see the savings.   Save money on some great Amazon products Let's look at a few examples of how both of these promotions work. Since the $5-off-$30 offer and 30% discount seem to be slightly more common among targeted Amex customers, we used those offers to demonstrate the potential savings on some popular items. With kids now back in school, whether in person or remote, it's important to outfit your child with all those essential school supplies. And this Crayola Masterworks Art Case has all of their coloring needs in mind. Currently on sale at Amazon for $44.99, once the discount is applied with the $5-off-$30 offer, you're looking at just under $40 plus taxes and shipping. And with parents working from home themselves, if you're looking to enhance your in-home office with some of our picks for the bestselling light therapy lamps, an extra 30% discount can make a big difference on the Northern Light Technologies Boxelite 10,000 Lux Bright Light Therapy Light Box. You can even pair these discounts nicely with many of Amazon's daily deals or any of the retailer's other money-saving offers, like saving $20 when you spend $60 on select beauty products. Save on third-party gift cards too While the discount offers don't apply to Amazon gift cards, they do apply to many other third-party retailer gift cards that Amazon sells. And Amazon has literally hundreds of options, including retailers that might be useful right now such as Netflix, DoorDash, Safeway and more. So even if you don't need anything at Amazon at the moment, you can buy a gift card for yourself using the discount and bank the savings for later. Which American Express cards earn Membership Rewards points? Even if you're not targeted for these particular Amex promotions, offers like this typically resurface many times throughout the year, so keep on checking back. Amazon is also currently running similar promotions for Capital One credit card holders, Chase credit card holders and Discover credit card holders, so check out all of CNN Underscored's guides for the details. You might also find that even if you aren't eligible now for one of these offers, you could magically become targeted at any point before the offers expire, so keep on checking the offer links to see if you've been granted access. Amazon has been eagerly offering some lucrative promotions throughout 2020 — some of the best we've ever seen — so keep your eyes peeled for any other savings that may come your way. And if you're targeted for either of these offers, make sure you use them before they expire. If you don't currently have an eligible Amex card, here are several options you might consider: Amex personal cards:
American Express® Gold Card
American Express® Green Card
Amex Everyday® Credit Card From American Express Amex business cards:
The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express
American Express® Business Gold Card
The Business Platinum Card® from American Express Also, make sure you read our guide to the best credit cards for Amazon to be sure you're using the best card you have available when you buy at Amazon.

Last chance to save 20% at Amazon with targeted Discover credit cards,2020-04-24,"If you're a Discover card holder and an Amazon shopper, you might be in luck. There are currently two different targeted promotions that can help you save money on many products sold at Amazon when you use cash back points from select Discover cards. But both of these promotions are slated to end on September 30, so if you're going to take advantage of them, now's the time. The first targeted promotion offers a 20% discount on most products sold directly by Amazon when you use cash back points from select Discover cards. Some card holders are seeing a $10 maximum on this offer, while others are getting $20. But if you're eligible, you can save up to $20 when you use Discover cash back to pay for at least a portion of your purchase at checkout.  The second promotion offers $10 off a $60 purchase at Amazon, although some accounts might instead see an $80 or $100 minimum. If you're targeted for this one, all you have to do is use your Discover cash back to pay for at least a portion of your purchase at checkout by Sept. 30. There are a number of steps you'll need to follow to actually lock in the savings from either of these offers, so we've put together a step-by-step guide to ensure you're getting every penny. How to save 20% at Amazon with your Discover card For starters, in order to potentially be targeted for this promotion, you must have a Discover credit card. These include the Discover it® Cash Back, the Discover it® Miles and the Discover it® Chrome. If you have one of these cards but haven't connected your Discover card to your Amazon account, you'll need to link your two accounts. Log in to Amazon and add your Discover card as a payment method, then look for the option to enroll in ""Shop with Points"" under the ""Your Account"" tab. On the next screen, click the ""Enroll"" button for the Discover card you just added. Once your accounts are linked, you'll need to check to see if you're eligible for either offer: Click here to check if you're eligible for up to 20% off your purchase
Click here to check if you're eligible for $10 off a $60 purchase Unfortunately, both are targeted promotions, so you might see a message saying that you're not eligible, even if you have a Discover card connected to your Amazon account. Also, if you just enrolled in ""Shop with Points,"" you may need to wait 24 hours for Amazon's records to refresh before being able to activate the offer. If you're eligible, make sure to activate either — or both — offers by clicking on the ""Activate now"" button. You can then go ahead and shop at Amazon as you normally would, but during the checkout process, you'll want to select your linked Discover card as your payment method. You'll then need to apply at least 1 Discover cash back point to pay for your purchase to trigger the 20% discount. Related: Lower your expenses by getting one of these credit cards with no annual fee. Amazon might automatically default to applying points for the full purchase amount, but you can manually change it and designate the number of points you want to apply toward your purchase — as little as 1 point if you want. The rest of the purchase can then be paid for with your Discover card.  Fortunately, you'll get the same value when redeeming your Discover cash back at Amazon as you'd receive if you chose a statement credit redemption instead. Basically, $1 in cash back equals $1 at Amazon, which means you're getting the same 1 cent per point. This is a much better value than what you'd receive when using American Express or Chase points, who often run similar Amazon promotions for their own card members. Related: Get up to 40% off at Amazon with targeted American Express cards. Once you've applied at least 1 point to your payment, you'll see the discount added to your order, but keep in mind you'll only see the discount on items sold directly by Amazon, not most third-party sellers.  For the $10 off promotion, you'll need to place a single order with the minimum purchase amount to see the savings. With the 20% discount offer, the discount will apply to all of your Amazon orders placed between now and Sept. 30 until you reach the $20 maximum savings. You just need to pay with your Discover cash card each time and apply at least 1 point.  Get discounts on some great Amazon products Either of these promotions will save you money — and you can save even more if you're lucky enough to be targeted for both. But let's look at a few examples to see how the 20% discount works using the $20 maximum, since that's potentially the more lucrative of the two promotions. In CNN Underscored's recent roundup of the best kitchen knife sets of 2020, this Chicago Cutlery Fusion 17-Piece Knife Block Set was named our overall best knife set. Currently pricing at $106, you can snag these top-notch kitchen utensils for just $86 plus taxes and shipping once the $20 Capital One discount is applied. Or, if you're looking for something more on the go, you can get this 64GB Apple iPad mini for $329.99 with the 20% discount as of this writing, plus taxes and shipping. You can even pair these promotions with many of Amazon's daily deals or any of its other money-saving offers, like saving $20 when you spend $60 on select beauty products. Related: Pay off your debt faster with these balance transfer credit cards. 20% off third-party gift cards too While these Discover discounts don't apply to Amazon gift cards, they do apply to many other third-party gift cards that Amazon sells. And Amazon literally has hundreds of options, including retailers that might be useful right now such as Netflix, DoorDash, Safeway and more. So even if you don't have anything you need at Amazon at the moment, you can buy a gift card for yourself using the discount and bank the savings for later. What should you do if you're not targeted? If you're not targeted for either of these particular Discover promotions, keep checking back, as sometimes previously ineligible customers are suddenly eligible. Similar offers also re-surface throughout the year, so there's a chance you'll be able to receive savings at another point in 2020.  You can also see if you're eligible for a similar promotion Amazon currently has on American Express cards that could score you a discount of up to 40% if you're targeted. There's also a Chase offer for $15 off a $50 purchase at Amazon, and Capital One has its own 20% off promotion for its credit card holders at Amazon. If you happen to be eligible for both one of the Discover offers and an offer with another credit card, you could be looking at a total of well over $100 in savings. But keep in mind that you can't combine points from different credit card programs on a single purchase. And if you don't have any of these credit cards, make sure you check out our guide to be sure you're using the best credit card for Amazon purchases, even if you can't get any discounts right now. With Amazon being a go-to shopping site right now for many households, this promotion is the perfect way to save money if you're eligible. But there's only a short time left to take advantage of it, since it ends on September 30. So make sure you take a look if you're a Discover card holder, and if you're targeted, get your $10 or 20% discount — or maybe both — when you buy from Amazon today!

These cozy pajamas from Amazon will have you sleeping in style,2020-02-14,"Sleep is vital to our health and moods — new research seems to spring up weekly telling us so. So no wonder we've spent a fair share of our time thoughtfully curating our pillows, sheets, eye masks, lavender balms, white noise machines and whatever else we need to promote a restful night.  What's next in our quest to get more sleep in 2020? New sleepwear, of course. Whether you're a hot or cold sleeper or an insomniac, or you're hard to rouse or never even thought about what brand of snoozer you are, we've picked out some of the top-rated (and most stylish) pajamas on Amazon. Whether it be pajama sets, onesies, nightshirts or boxers, all of our picks have at least a 4-star rating and come with hundreds (if not thousands) of reviews. And since it's Amazon, you know most of these can be delivered in a flash.  Latuza Women's V-Neck Sleepwear Short Sleeve Pajama Set (starting at $19.99; amazon.com) We love the simplicity of this pajama set, and with more than 3,000 reviews, customers seem to agree. They're an especially good pick for ""hot sleepers."" One customer experiencing menopausal night sweats writes that ""the material instantly cooled my body... allowing me to have a good rest.""  _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Pajamas Set Long Sleeve Sleepwear (starting at $34.99; amazon.com) With over 1,900 5-star ratings, this traditional 95% viscose two-piece set is super comfy, with a cute notch collar — and available in loads of patterns. _______________________________________________________________________________ Didk Cartoon Print Pajama Set (starting at $16.14; amazon.com)  If you're not afraid of a little print, this pajama set comes covered in everything from avocados to panda bears to peaches and ice cream cones. But more than the print, the more than 4,500 reviewers have pointed out how ridiculously soft these are. They're also known to be a tad oversized, so keep that in mind when ordering.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Short Sleeve Sleepwear (starting at $25.99; amazon.com)  Ranked among the best pajamas for hot sleepers, this set utilizes super-soft viscose (plus a cute retro style) to keep you cool while you snooze. With more than 3,100 reviews, it's also available in a wide array of colors and patterns.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Serenedelicacy Women's Silky Satin Pajamas (starting at $19.99; amazon.com) Silky, leopard print PJs should be a staple for everyone, in our humble opinion. And with a loads of different patterns (think polka dots, too), these are nearly irresistible.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Fruit of the Loom Men's Jersey Sleep Pant (starting at $10; amazon.com)  For the guy who's a more casual sleepwear enthusiast, these sleep pants may really be all he needs. With a whopping 12,000 reviews to its name, these (mostly) cotton pants come with a button front closure, a drawstring elastic waist and deep pockets.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Hanes Men's Woven Plain-Weave Pajama Set (starting at $21.95; amazon.com) For anyone feeling a bit Don Draper on a weeknight, this cotton pajama set with retro-inspired piping is beloved by more than 3,400 reviewers.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Lonxu Womens Silk Satin Pajamas Set ($28.98; amazon.com) Silky button-downs feel like a luxury, and these come at such a reasonable price. (No wonder they have more than 3,900 reviews.) One reviewer calls them ""silky, shiny, and oh so soft on my skin. I feel like Kim Kardashian in these.""  _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Women's Sleep Shirt Dress (starting at $9.99; amazon.com)  Nightgowns can be tricky. Pick one too long and you could feel like an extra on ""Little House on the Prairie."" Pick one too short and you'll never be able to comfortably wear it around company. This one, with its scoop neckline, pretty lace detailing, extra-soft fabric and perfect nightgown length is among the most beloved nightgowns on Amazon. With more than 3,200 reviews, it comes in not just a variety of colors (really every one you can think of), but prints like stripes, the night's sky and more.  _______________________________________________________________________________ CYZ Womens Casual Stretch Cotton Pajama Pants (starting at $14.99; amazon.com) A basic pair of house pants is something everyone needs. These are a well-priced option, as one of the more than 4,000 reviewers put it, for sleeping, lounging or ""out for quick errands."" They're also available in a variety of neutral colors, as well as prints that feature moon and stars and even polka dots.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Sleepwear Satin Pajamas Cami Shorts Set (starting at $12.74; amazon.com) For those who like a skimpier lingerie style that are still comfortable, these are a great bet. The spaghetti-strap top features a V-neck, and the shorts come with tiny slit accents on the size. Some reviewers have mentioned that these run small, so size up.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Avidlove Women's Short Sleeve Pajama Set (starting at $22.99; amazon.com) A solid colored, very cozy standby — and loose fitting in a kind of alluring way. As one reviewer pointed out, you're getting ""very expensive pajamas for the price,"" and a set that can transition from winter to summer for hot sleepers.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Hanes Women's Wear Around Nightshirt ($9.56, originally $14; amazon.com) For the oversize-tee-as-sleepwear crowd, this is a big winner, with nearly 5,000 reviews. Customers say it runs large (as you can imagine), so if you like sleepwear that isn't super close to your skin, this one also may be a good fit. Otherwise, order one or two sizes smaller than usual.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Striped Short Sleeve Sleepwear Set (starting at $23.99; amazon.com) Tailored with cute nautical details — you could nearly wear these on a sailing excursion, or just fall asleep and dream about one. _______________________________________________________________________________ Avidlove Women's Pajama Set Short Sleeve Sleepwear ($21.99; amazon.com) The lacey cutout at the shoulder gives these basics an of-the-boudoir vibe without trying too hard. _______________________________________________________________________________ Ekouaer Bandage One Piece Pajama Romper (starting at $27.99; amazon.com) Who says onesies are just for children? As one enthusiastic purchaser puts it, ""Onesies are my go-to de-stressing loungewear because they make me feel like a little kid again.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/cnn-underscored/best-pajamas-on-amazon/index.html,CNN,_all
