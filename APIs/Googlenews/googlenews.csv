The funding cut could set back critical research into preventing such disease spread, scientists say. They also expressed dismay that the decision was prompted by unfounded conspiracy theories and what some see as a wider attempt by the Trump administration to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic by blaming China for unleashing the disease.

The NIH has not provided a clear explanation for its move to cancel the funds, which occurred April 24 and was first reported by Politico Monday, April 27. However, in email exchanges published April 30 by Science magazine, it is clear that the NIH was motivated by conspiracy theories that allege—without evidence—that the virus was somehow released by Chinese researchers in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the pandemic began.

The grant that is now going unfunded is titled “Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence,” and it was written by EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., a non-profit based in New York that collaborates with a leading Chinese researcher who studies bat coronaviruses in Wuhan. The NIH initially funded the work in 2014, providing $3.1 million for five years. The NIH then renewed the grant in 2019 after the work received an outstanding peer-review score, according to Science.

The magazine reported that $599,000 of the initial grant money went to Shi Zhengli, a virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) who collaborates with EcoHealth. Shi and her colleagues have collected more than 15,000 biological samples from wild bats and received a portion of the NIH funding to do genetic studies that would identify coronaviruses at high risk of jumping to humans. The grant also supported studies testing the blood of people living near bat caves in southern China, to see if the residents had been infected with bat coronaviruses.

“The reason our grant was renewed for five years is because our work is so important in helping prevent pandemics,” Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, told Science. The project had generated at least 20 published research studies and several genetic sequences of bat coronaviruses, some of which have been used to help vet remdesivir, a potential drug therapy against COVID-19.

Lab origins

However, amid the pandemic, conspiracy theories have festered online that Chinese researchers were responsible for the release of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. First, there was speculation that it was a man-made virus, potentially one intended for biowarfare. When genetic analysis clearly contradicted that notion, speculation shifted to suggesting that it was a natural virus that accidentally escaped a laboratory in Wuhan, potentially the WIV where Shi works. The idea has been bolstered by a column in The Washington Post that US Department of State officials had vague safety concerns about the lab back in 2018.

Though researchers can’t completely rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab, coronavirus experts have consistently said it is far more likely that SARS-CoV-2 leapt from wild bats or other wild animals to humans in a natural spillover event, similar to how SARS-CoV-2’s coronavirus relatives caused disease. That is, the coronaviruses behind SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) both hopped naturally from wild bats to other animals before making their way to humans to cause disease.

Moreover, there’s no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was among Shi’s collection, and there’s no indication that any researchers or the NIH was concerned about safety issues at the lab, according to Science.

Politics

Still, the unfounded idea has continued, reportedly with pressure from the Trump administration to find evidence to substantiate it. Trump said on Thursday that he had seen evidence that SARS-CoV-2 came from WIV but was “not allowed” to say more.

In an initial email to EcoHealth on April 19, Michael Lauer, NIH deputy director for Extramural Research, reportedly wrote:

The scientific community believes that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 jumped from bats to humans likely in Wuhan where the COVID-19 pandemic began. There are now allegations that the current crisis was precipitated by the release from Wuhan Institute of Virology of the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Given these concerns, we are pursuing suspension of Wuhan Institute of Virology from participation in federal programs.

In a subsequent email on April 24, Lauer wrote that the NIH has “elected to terminate the project ‘Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence’… for convenience.”

“This grant was funded as a discretionary grant as outlined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement which states that the decision not to award a grant, or to award a grant at a particular funding level, is at the discretion of the agency, in accordance with NIH’s dual review system,” the email went on. “At this time, NIH does not believe that the current project outcomes align with the program goals and agency priorities.”

Dennis Carroll, who recently retired as director of the emerging threats division of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), noted to Science that “there’s a culture of attacking really critical science for cheap political gain.”

In a statement to Politico, EcoHealth noted: “We work in the United States and in over 25 countries with institutions that have been pre-approved by federal funding agencies to do scientific research critical to preventing pandemics. We are planning to talk with NIH to understand the rationale behind their decision.”",
1,"May 3, 2020",The Guardian,"Hostile states trying to steal coronavirus research, says UK agency","Hostile states are attempting to hack British universities and scientific facilities to steal research related to Covid-19, including vaccine development, cybersecurity experts have warned.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the proportion of such targeted cyber-attacks had increased, branding the criminal activity “reprehensible”.

It is understood that nations including Iran and Russia are behind the hacking attempts, while experts have said China is also a likely perpetrator.

There are thought to be dozens of universities and institutions with biomedical capacity working on Covid-19 research, ranging from new diagnostic and antibody tests to experimental treatment.

However, it is understood there have been no successful attacks on universities or research institutions to date.

A spokesperson for the NCSC said: “Any attack against efforts to combat the coronavirus crisis is utterly reprehensible. We have seen an increased proportion of cyber-attacks related to coronavirus and our experts work around the clock to help organisations targeted.

“However, the overall level of cyber-attacks from both criminals and states against the UK has remained stable during the pandemic.”

The University of Oxford, which is making world-leading efforts on vaccine development and recently started human trials, said it was working with the NCSC to protect its research.

AstraZeneca, the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical group, is teaming up with the university to manufacture and distribute the vaccine if the clinical trials show it is effective.

A university spokesperson said: “Oxford University is working closely with the NCSC to ensure our Covid-19 research has the best possible cybersecurity and protection.”

James Sullivan, a former cyber-analyst for the National Crime Agency and head of cyber research at the Royal United Services Institute, the international defence and security thinktank, said it was not surprising that hostile states were targeting Covid-19 research.

“The pandemic will lead to a general increase in hostile state cyber-activity,” he said. “It is a new opportunity for intelligence gathering and disruption. We’ve seen this with disinformation campaigns, cyber-espionage; there’s a risk of these all exacerbating political tension and it’s no surprise this is happening in an area such as the development of a vaccine.”

He added: “As we’ve seen with cyber-attacks, whether it’s a hostile nation state or an organised criminal, there’s no real boundaries to the types of data they try to steal, so why would this be any different if the development of a vaccine is a very competitive area? We’re seeing those geopolitical tensions played out in this space.”

Sullivan said the attacks highlighted the problems with cybersecurity in the healthcare sector. In 2017, the NHS fell victim to the global WannaCry ransomware attack, with tens of thousands of devices affected.

Earlier this month the health secretary, Matt Hancock, signed off a directive giving GCHQ, the intelligence service, access and oversight to the NHS IT network.

Meanwhile, a dossier prepared by governments for the so-called Five Eyes nations, an intelligence alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, alleges that China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak.

The move cost tens of thousands of lives, according to the document obtained by the Australian Daily Telegraph, which lays the foundation for a case of negligence being mounted against China.

It states that to the “endangerment of other countries” the Chinese government covered-up the virus by silencing or “disappearing” doctors who spoke out, destroying evidence of it in laboratories and refusing to provide live samples to international scientists who were working on a vaccine.",

On Saturday, the city announced it will close the parking lots at five of the city’s large parks as of Sunday to enforce physical distancing as the warmer weather arrives and the public flocks to the city’s green spaces.

The five parks affected are La Fontaine, Jarry, Maisonneuve, Frédéric-Back and the Île-de-la-Visitation nature park.

Quebec boosts COVID-19 testing

On Friday, Quebec’s public health director Dr. Horacio Arruda announced the province’s new boosted COVID-19 screening strategy.

The number of daily tests will be considerably increased for different symptomatic groups of the population, totalling around 100,000 tests per week.

Arruda said particular attention will be paid to Montreal North, where officials are observing significant community transmission.

3,"May 2, 2020",CBC.ca,Scientists aim to 'see' invisible transmission of coronavirus,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through droplets that we spew as we breathe, talk, cough and sneeze — so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye.

That's why questions remain about the virus's transmission and what precautions need to be taken to curb its spread as governments begin to lift restrictions. Will it help if everyone wears a mask? Is keeping everyone two metres apart far enough?

Some researchers aim to learn more about transmission by trying to make invisible sneezes, coughs and breaths more visible. Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal.

How do scientists think COVID-19 is transmitted?

According to the World Health Organization, the disease spreads primarily through tiny droplets expelled when a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 sneezes, coughs, exhales or spits while talking. They can infect another person who:

Comes into contact with those droplets through their eyes, nose or mouth (droplet transmission).

Touches objects or surfaces on which droplets have landed and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth (contact transmission).

Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHO's technical lead for infection prevention and control, told journalists on July 7 there was evidence emerging of airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus, but that it was not definitive.



""The possibility of airborne transmission in public settings — especially in very specific conditions [like] crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings that have been described — cannot be ruled out,"" Allegranzi said.



""However, the evidence needs to be gathered and interpreted, and we continue to support this.""

WHO was responding to questions raised by 239 scientists in 32 countries in an open letter calling on health authorities ""to recognize the potential for airborne spread of COVID-19.""

The UN health agency plans to publish a scientific brief summarizing the state of knowledge on modes of transmission of the virus.

Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead on the COVID-19 pandemic at the WHO, continues to recommend a combination of measures to prevent transmission.



""This includes not only physical distancing, it includes the use of masks where appropriate in certain settings, specifically where you can't do physical distancing and especially for health-care workers.""

The WHO says it's important to stay ""more than one metre away"" from a person who is sick.

The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends staying a distance of at least two metres or two arms' lengths away, not just from people who are sick but from all people you don't live with.

Why is 2 metres the recommended distance for preventing transmission?

Scientists in the 19th century showed respiratory droplets from a person's nose and mouth can carry micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses.

Then, in 1934, W.F. Wells at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that large droplets (bigger than 0.1 millimetre) tended to fall and settle on the ground within a distance of two metres, while smaller droplets evaporated and the virus particles left behind could remain suspended in the air for a long time.

Wells proposed that could explain how diseases are transmitted.

Since then, respiratory diseases have been divided into those transmitted via droplets (usually from close contact) and those that are airborne and can spread over longer distances, such as measles or tuberculosis.

Such tiny particles are presumably pushed around by air currents, but can't move easily due to air resistance. So their actual movements haven't been well modelled or measured, said Lydia Bourouiba, professor and director of the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""And that's why the notion of airborne [transmission] is very murky,"" said Bourouiba, who is Canadian.

Why don't experts think the virus is airborne?

A pair of recent studies raised the notion of airborne transmission, but Mark Loeb, a professor at Hamilton's McMaster University who specializes in infectious disease research, cautions against putting too much stock in them.

Researchers found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in washrooms and some high-traffic areas in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and in Nebraska, and suggested it got into those areas through the air, though there was no evidence the particles were still infectious.

Loeb said that's just a ""signal"" that part of the virus was there.

""Does it mean that COVID-19 is spreading from person to person through aerosols? I would say definitively not,"" Loeb said.

Infectious disease experts say research that found pieces of coronavirus suspected to have travelled through the air showed no evidence that those particles were still infectious. 1:59

If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted.

""The reason we know that is because all around the world we have hundreds of health-care workers who are taking care of patients wearing regular masks,"" she said. ""If this were airborne — if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles — all those health-care workers would be getting sick.""

The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious.

Infection control guidelines do recommend extra personal protective equipment (including N-95 respirators) to protect against airborne transmission for health-care workers performing procedures that generate high concentrations of aerosolized particles, such as intubations, on COVID-19 patients, McGeer said.

But even in that scenario, the degree to which those particles are infectious hasn't been yet proven — and it's a very different scenario than what people are facing in the community.

""You and I don't have to worry walking down the street that we're going to be breathing the air of somebody who walked down the street five minutes ahead of us who had COVID-19 and didn't know it,"" said McGeer, ""That we can be confident about.""

McGeer said to focus on taking precautions against the certainties.

Is there evidence the virus could be spread farther than 2 metres?

Some studies, including Bourouiba's, show that droplets from coughs and sneezes can, in fact, travel much farther than expected. Bourouiba's high-speed imaging measurements and modelling show smaller respiratory droplets don't behave like individual droplets but are in a turbulent gas cloud trapping them and carrying them forward within it. The moist environment reduces evaporation, allowing droplets of many sizes to survive much longer and travel much farther than two metres — up to seven or eight metres, in the case of a sneeze .

She said the research ""is about revealing what you cannot see with the naked eye.""

A more recent Canadian study used a ""cough chamber"" to show that if someone coughs without covering their mouth, droplets from the cough are still travelling at a speed of about one kilometre per hour when they hit the two-metre edge of the chamber. Within the chamber, droplets remained suspended for up to three minutes.

Dr. Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who co-authored the study, said it ""gives you a sense of what the possibilities are,"" but noted that the researchers, who were studying flu patients, detected very little virus in the droplets.

What does that say about the 2-metre guideline?

Bourouiba says her research points to the potential for exposure beyond two metres from someone who is coughing and sneezing. As she wrote in the journal JAMA Insights in March, that means it's ""vitally important"" for health care workers to wear high-grade personal protective equipment in the form of respirators even if they're farther than two metres away from infected patients.

However, she does think two metres can be far enough for healthy people in the general public in most environments, since breathing and talking don't propel droplets and surrounding cloud too far.

Mubareka stands by the two-metre guideline despite the findings of her cough chamber study.

Despite dramatic images of respiratory droplets being propelled from someone's nose and mouth, it's not yet clear how many of them contain virus and how many are infectious.

""And that's really the key variable — that's what really determines your risk,"" she said. ""Those are the kinds of things we haven't been able to measure."" That may change, she added, with the recent invention of particle samplers designed specifically for viruses.

Loeb of McMaster, notes that a cough chamber and similar laboratory setups are highly artificial settings and controlled environments.

""They're basically saying what's theoretically possible,"" he said. ""I think those are provocative and those are hypothesis- generating, but then they need to be tested in the field.""

Loeb is running such a field test himself — a randomized controlled trial of the use of medical versus N95 masks among health care workers to see if there is a difference in the transmission of COVID-19.

But are coughing and sneezing all we need to worry about?

That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.

Even though researchers aren't sure exactly how people without symptoms transmit the disease, the new evidence has prompted both U.S. and Canadian officials to suggest apparently healthy people wear masks in public to protect others — ""because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau famously explained .

""People generate particles when they're talking, singing, breathing — so you don't have to necessarily be coughing,"" Mubareka said. ""It's just that maybe the dispersion is a little bit more limited.""

WATCH | The droplets produced when someone speaks with, and without, a mask

This video, from a study published in April 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, uses laser light scattering to show droplets produced when someone speaks. 0:42

A recent brief video and report by U.S. National Institutes of Health researchers used lasers to show that droplets projected less than 10 centimetres when someone says the phrase ""Stay healthy."" It found the louder someone spoke, the more droplets were emitted.

But they were dramatically reduced if a damp washcloth — a stand-in for a mask — was placed over the speaker's mouth.

So what about using masks to curb the spread of COVID-19?

Studies have already provided evidence that the rate at which sick people shed the virus into their surroundings is reduced when they wear a mask.

Other studies, such as a 2009 paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface , use imaging to show how wearing a mask while coughing reduces the jet of air that's normally directed forward and down. A surgical mask ""effectively blocks the forward momentum of the cough jet and its aerosol content,"" the study found. Some does leak out the sides, top and bottom, but without much momentum.

The World Health Organization recommends that people wear masks if they are coughing and sneezing or if they are caring for someone who is sick.

It notes that studies haven't been conducted yet on whether or not transmission is reduced when healthy people wear masks in public, but it encourages countries to look into that.

Many governments haven't waited. Los Angeles, Italy and Austria are among the places that have begun requiring customers to wear masks while shopping.

The Public Health Agency of Canada advises people to consult their local public health authority for the latest assessment of the risk of coronavirus exposure in your area, and current advice and recommendations tailored to the local situation.

Provinces across the country are set to begin easing COVID-19 restrictions on Monday following a weekend in which thousands more cases of the respiratory illness were identified, hundreds more were reported dead and a much-ballyhooed made-in-Canada testing kit was recalled.

Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are among those set to take another step out of lockdown by allowing the resumption of some economic and social activities that have been halted for than a month due to the pandemic.

Manitoba is poised to go the farthest by allowing museums, libraries and retail businesses — including restaurant patios — to re-open, albeit at half capacity. Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are also letting non-essential medical activities, such as dentistry and physiotherapy, resume.

Ontario and Quebec aren’t going as far. Ontario is allowing a small number of mostly seasonal businesses to re-open while Quebec is easing the lockdown on most retail stores outside the Montreal area, which has been hit hard by COVID-19 over the past month and a half.

Yet unlike the other provinces, Quebec’s plan to begin re-opening comes as the province has shown little progress in curbing the illness’s spread, with another 1,800 positive cases and 183 deaths from the disease reported over the weekend.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault has previously defended plans to start re-opening, noting most of the province’s deaths have been in long-term care homes and arguing the fight against COVID-19 is entirely different in those facilities.

Quebec officials also added more than 1,300 cases to April’s count, saying those numbers weren’t originally included because of a technical problem. The province accounts for more than half of the Canadian cases of COVID-19, which includes more than 3,680 deaths.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault did not hold a briefing on Sunday, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other federal government officials sidestepped questions in Ottawa about the province’s plan to begin re-opening even as more cases continue to be reported.

Those plans also include unlocking elementary schools and daycares across Quebec on May 11.

“Different regions will have different measures to bring in at different times and our job is to make sure we’re supporting them as best we can as we go through this carefully and step by step,” Trudeau said during his daily COVID-19 update.

That federal support includes obtaining enough protective equipment for workers as provinces open more segments of their economies, helping increase testing capacity and supporting research into COVID-19.

It was in that vein that Trudeau announced $175 million in federal funding to a Vancouver biotech company, AbCellera Biologics Inc., which the prime minister says has identified antibodies that could be used to create treatments or a vaccine.

The prime minister also announced $240 million to boost online access to health services, including mental-health treatment and virtual access to family doctors for primary care, and the creation of a special council tasked with ensuring Canada can obtain more protective equipment.

Public Procurement Minister Anita Anand said the council will include members from business and civil society, including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Red Cross, and will be charged with buying equipment from abroad and developing it at home.

Anand went on to outline some of the initiatives that the federal government has pursued to obtain more protective equipment for frontline workers, including hiring the U.S. shipping firm UPS to ferry equipment from Shanghai.

Agreements have also been reached with New Brunswick-based biotech firm LuminUltra to produce 500,000 COVID-19 tests per week until next year after Ottawa was able to facilitate the delivery of important chemicals for the tests from China last week.

Yet even as Anand was hailing one made-in-Canada solution to the country’s need for more tests, federal officials were playing down the recall of another test that was being hailed by some last month as a major advance in the fight against COVID-19.

Ottawa-based Spartan Bioscience’s announcement Sunday that it was voluntarily recalling its rapid test for COVID-19 after Health Canada expressed concern about its effectiveness nonetheless represented a setback for expanded testing in the country.

Health Canada first approved the tests on April 13 and they were set to be rolled out by three provinces.

Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said during a COVID-19 briefing in Ottawa that the recall of 5,500 testing kits won’t affect the national testing goal of 60,000 people a day, since that figure is based on systems already in use.

But she acknowledged that it could affect the speed of further test increases and especially affect rural communities where local in-clinic tests would be especially useful. At the moment, such samples are often transported to laboratories and other testing sites elsewhere for analysis.

The need for more testing is widely considered to understanding the true scope of COVID-19 infection in Canada and devising ways to limit its spread before the economy can be fully restored to pre-pandemic levels.

Trudeau, meanwhile, sidestepped questions about unsubstantiated reports from the United States that some intelligence officials believe the novel coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab in the city of Wuhan — an allegation repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We will continue to work with intelligence agencies around the world, not just the Five Eyes (Canada, Australia, Britain, New Zealand and the U.S.) but friends and partners as well and look to find answers to the many questions people are asking,” Trudeau said.

The Ontario government says it is allowing certain business and workplaces to reopen on May 4, as long as they comply with strict public health measures set out during the coronavirus pandemic.

Some businesses permitted to start back up include seasonal businesses and some essential construction projects.

“We have consulted with our chief medical officer, and today we are able to move forward with opening a small, small list of very specific businesses,” Premier Doug Ford said. “Many of these are seasonable businesses that we are confident can operate safely as long as they comply with public health measures and workplace guidelines.”

Ford made the announcement at Queen’s Park on Friday afternoon alongside Minister of Finance Rod Phillips, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli and Minister of Health Christine Elliott.

The province on Thursday provided more than 60 guidelines for various business sectors to reopen safely.

“These sector-specific measures will help employers prepare their workplaces so they can be reopened safely and ensure workers, customers and the general public are protected,” the province said.

On Monday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m., if they are following the proper health and safety guidelines, the province said these businesses will be permitted to begin operations:

Garden centres and nurseries with curbside pick-up and delivery only.

Lawn care and landscaping.

Additional essential construction projects that include: shipping and logistics; broadband, telecommunications, and digital infrastructure; any other project that supports the improved delivery of goods and services; municipal projects; colleges and universities; child care centres; schools; and site preparation, excavation, and servicing for institutional, commercial, industrial and residential development.

Automatic and self-serve car washes.

Auto dealerships, open by appointment only.

Golf courses may prepare their courses for the upcoming season, but not open to the public.

Marinas may also begin preparations for the recreational boating season by servicing boats and other watercraft and placing boats in the water, but not open to the public. Boats and watercraft must be secured to a dock in the marina until public access is allowed.

“In the coming days and weeks, I am hopeful that we will meet more of our health targets.” Ford continued. “I am very optimistic that in the near future that we will be able to announce additional businesses will be able to open up safely.”

When it comes to enforcement, Ford told reporters that it will be up to bylaw officers across the province.

He also spoke about the challenges of securing PPE (personal protective equipment) and hand sanitizer for businesses even as the province looks at ramping up supply.

“It’s a challenge, it’s a challenge on all fronts,” Ford said.

“We’re gonna work as hard as we can to make sure that the businesses have their requirements that they need.”

On Friday, Ontario reported 421 new coronavirus cases and 39 new deaths — totaling 16,608 cases and 1,121 deaths since the outbreak began.

As Canadian provinces look at relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, a new set of measures are blowing in — like the “double bubble.”

Also called the “family bubble” or “new bubble,” the measure essentially allows two households to link, giving people a chance to socialize and interact with others.

New Brunswick was the first to float the idea. It’s one of the first steps the province is taking in its plan to reopen the economy while still keeping the spread of the coronavirus at bay.

Rules do apply. Public health officials stressed that the households are not interchangeable. Once you combine two households, that’s the way it stays. The decision to join bubbles also needs to be agreed upon by both households.

The measure also recently popped into Newfoundland and Labrador’s reopening plan.

“I hope that this will help reduce some of the social isolation we all feel,” the province’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, said. “Especially those living alone.”

While it’s a “smart” way forward with many benefits for families, it needs to be contextualized with where and when it’s being applied, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital.

“Timing is everything,” he said. “Some provinces are further along or didn’t have the same degree of the pandemic affecting them. These provinces are much better prepared from a community transmission standpoint than other places.”

New Brunswick has recorded 118 cases of the virus and zero deaths as of May 1. Newfoundland and Labrador sit a little higher, at 258 cases and three deaths. Both provinces pale in comparison to more highly populated and denser parts of the country, like Ontario and Quebec, which have more than 16,600 and 27,500 cases, respectively.

But the approach could very well drift to those harder-hit provinces as they get case counts and community transmission rates under control, said Bogoch.

The “bubble strategy” is not yet in the plans for Manitoba, where health orders have eased somewhat. In Ontario, which laid out a phased plan with no timeline, the idea is on their radar. Their chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, said his team of experts will watch to see how it plays out elsewhere before advising it.

“It’s premature to do this in, say, Quebec right now. But New Brunswick and Newfoundland, they’re not just flicking a switch and suddenly reducing all their public health restrictions,” Bogoch said.

There are obvious benefits to families, Bogoch added. Concerns about child care have been raised as provinces outline their unique plans to relax restrictions. Some businesses and services will soon reopen, but schools are likely to stay closed and summer is fast approaching.

Linking two households may alleviate some of those stresses, said Craig Janes, director of the School of Public Health and Health Systems at the University of Waterloo.

“We’ve probably seen a lot of this anyway, kind of informally. I know here people here in Waterloo who are separated from their spouse or partner and the kids are going back and forth,” he said.

“The idea is to allow a little bit more contact between households that might normally be in contact.”

But there are serious risks to take into consideration, he said, since “not every bubble is going to be the same as other bubbles.”

Vulnerable people — particularly the elderly — are more susceptible to contracting the virus and are more likely to face more serious outcomes.

While it may seem like the right idea to bring grandma and grandpa into your home, some “common sense” is needed before you make a decision, Janes said.

“It’s context-dependent. If I bring my grandparents into my home and things reopen, so I go back to work, it will increase the risk for those in the home. The disease is spread from person to person, so the more you increase the number of contacts, the risk goes up,” he said. “Under those circumstances, I would think twice about expanding.”

Double bubbling is an approach Canada has borrowed from New Zealand. The country is also looking at creating travel bubbles, based on the same concept, after seeing a steady decrease in COVID-19 cases.

However, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has warned New Zealanders against bringing too many people into their expanded family “bubbles.”

“We are opening up the economy, but we’re not opening up people’s social lives,” she said.

Fitzgerald, the top doctor in N.L., offered the same warning: “The fewer interactions that you can have outside of your bubble the better.”

Ultimately, the same rules apply if you choose to double your bubble, Bogoch said. Good hand hygiene and continued physical distancing from those outside your linked households will keep risks of contracting the virus low and your family members safe.

“You still have to do everything you can to prevent bringing the infection into the household, because now it affects not just one, but two households.”

The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority have declared an outbreak of COVID-19 in Beauval, Sask., following an increasing number of cases.

Someone at the Beauval General Store had tested positive for the coronavirus on April 28. Anyone who shopped or bought gas there between April 12 and 27 is being asked to self-monitor daily for COVID-19 symptoms.

A contact tracing investigation is currently underway.

The outbreak — the province’s fourth — was declared as Saskatchewan reported 26 new coronavirus cases in Saskatchewan on Friday, bringing the overall total to 415.

It’s the largest one-day jump in cases in Saskatchewan since 30 new cases were reported on March 27.

“This is a fast-developing situation which we’ve just been alerted to and is continuing to evolve,” said SHA CEO Scott Livingstone during Friday afternoon’s press conference.

There are other outbreaks in La Loche, Lloydminster and the Victoria Hospital in Prince Albert. The first outbreak was announced on April 17 in La Loche with all other outbreaks announced this week.

Despite the increase in cases and outbreaks in several areas of the province, Dr. Saqib Shahab said Phase 1 of the Reopen Saskatchewan plan will go ahead on May 4 except in Lloydminster and La Loche.

“We are able to proceed with reopening because things remain quite flat in terms of the curve in most of Saskatchewan,” said the province’s chief medical health officer.

“But, I think we need to obviously pause that in settings where there are outbreaks.”

Shahab said it would be irresponsible not to go ahead with a phased reopening.

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

8,"May 3, 2020",Globalnews.ca,Researchers ‘very confident’ vaccine for coronavirus will be developed,"Send this page to someone via email

Thousands of researchers around the world have been working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to treat the novel coronavirus that has wreaked havoc across the globe.

READ MORE: A look at what could happen without a coronavirus vaccine

Now, months after the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, researchers are honing in on a possible vaccine.

But, they say it could be two years before any such vaccine would be ready for public consumption.

Challenges to vaccine development

The biggest challenge researchers face when trying to develop vaccines for emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2 is a lack of information, Dr. Alyson Kelvin, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University’s Toronto campus and a research scientist at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, told Global News.

Story continues below advertisement

She said because this novel coronavirus only spilled over into the human population a few months ago, researchers were essentially “starting from scratch.”

“We don’t have a clinical picture, we don’t have a genetic signature, we don’t have the protein signature,” she said. “We know nothing about this virus.”

She said scientists have had to study what the virus is made of and how it behaves in order to develop a target.

Dr. Matthew Miller, an associate professor at McMaster University’s department of biochemistry and biomedical sciences, said in general, coronaviruses pose a problem for vaccine development.

He explained that’s because researchers don’t have a very good understanding of what type of protection a vaccine would provide for this type of virus.

Story continues below advertisement

“For some vaccines, we know really, really specifically what cells in the immune system, for example, are really important for ensuring that you’re protected,” he said.

He said in some cases, scientists are able to measure “with pretty good confidence” whether a person is going to be protected from a virus or not.

But, this is not the case with SARS-CoV-2, Miller said.

“There are questions about how to generate a good protective response and how to measure that and what you need to measure,” he said. “And so that does pose a sort of significant challenge.”

[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]

But, these are not “insurmountable” challenges, said Dr. Natasha Crowcroft, director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto.

She said it’s “reasonable” to be optimistic that a vaccine will be developed.

“People have tried to develop vaccines before, but never have we put this much effort into trying to find something that will work,” she said. “Never have so many approaches been tried.”

She said scientists are trying both traditional and innovative methods, and are hoping to end up with more than one effective vaccine.

According to Kelvin, the most traditional type of vaccine takes the entire virus and kills it. A patient is then immunized so their immune system can identify the virus before it encounters the live version.

“So, we’re basically educating your immune army to get ready and know what it’s looking for before it has to deal with something that could cause disease,” she said.

This has proven to be a safe and effective type of vaccine for other viruses, Kelvin said, but it takes time to develop.

“We have to get the virus, we have to culture it and make lots and lots of it to kill it,” she said. Researchers then need to confirm the virus has actually been killed, and that the quality of the vaccine is good enough to be given to people, she added.

She said when it comes to SARS-CoV-2, there are a number of other types of trials underway, including protein-based vaccines, RNA vaccines and DNA vaccines. Each has a different timeline.

Kelvin noted a number of trials already appear to be “promising.”

Miller, too, said he is “very confident” researchers will be successful, saying it’s more likely that we end up with “several different vaccines” than none at all.

He said while the proposed two-year timeline is short, it’s “reasonable.”

Miller said it will allow for adequate pre-clinical and clinical trials while also providing manufacturers time to prepare to mass produce and distribute the vaccines.

“All of that takes time,” he said.

What happens if the virus mutates?

Miller added one “encouraging” thing about the novel coronavirus is that it does not appear to be mutating as quickly as other viruses, like influenza.

That means scientists are able to hone in and understand how the virus works without having to adapt to new changes.

Crowcroft explained while it’s unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 will mutate significantly, if a vaccine has been developed, scientists would be able to reformulate it.

She said this would likely be a shorter process than developing the vaccine in the first place because scientists would not be starting from scratch.

This is common practice with the influenza vaccine, she explained.

READ MORE: A look at research being done in Canada for a coronavirus vaccine

Kelvin said researchers have already begun working on a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which would be able to treat a wide range of coronaviruses.

She said this vaccine would also account for potential mutations in the virus.

What has the Canadian government said?

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the government will spend $1.1 billion for a national medical and research strategy that would include research into vaccines, treatments and supports for clinical trials.

He has also repeatedly stressed the importance of developing an effective treatment for the virus, saying the country will not return to “normal” until after a vaccine is developed.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trudeau said while trials are underway, the government has begun preparing to distribute vaccines once they become available.

“That is something that we are preparing already in terms of manufacturing and production capacity here in Canada because we know that countries around the world will be producing for their own citizens first and we need to be a part of that as well,” he said.

Kelvin said when it comes to supporting this research, Canada has “done a really good job.”

“They were much faster than the U.S. to get money out to where it was needed,” she said.

But, she said it is going to take “a lot of coordination” between the government, scientists and manufacturers in order to produce and distribute the vaccines once they are available.

“We need to have that partnership between scientists and industry to get this out to the whole population,” she said.

9,"May 1, 2020",Globalnews.ca,How many people is coronavirus really killing? Ontario’s data can’t tell us,"How many people is coronavirus killing?

It’s one of the most important questions about the most important problem for a generation.

Governments update the official tally every day, but experts warn that that number misses a lot of deaths linked to coronavirus. Without knowing the number of overall deaths — and comparing it to deaths in previous years — it’s impossible to tell the true number.

But unlike governments around the world, Ontario releases data on deaths far too slowly for us to answer the question. We’ll be able to see overall numbers of deaths for the period we’re now in, but not until January of 2022, officials say.

Why is that important?

All over the world, statistics have shown a disturbing fact: deaths have risen by far more than official totals of coronavirus deaths can account for.

Story continues below advertisement

In the U.K., deaths are 40,000 above normal levels, though less than half were attributed to coronavirus. In New York City, about 16,000 deaths are officially blamed on coronavirus — but that still leaves another 4,300 deaths above levels normal at this time of year. At least 10 countries, from Belgium to Ecuador, show similar patterns.

Experts Global News has talked to point to two causes: deaths related to coronavirus but attributed to other causes; and deaths indirectly linked to it, such as people with heart attacks who are reluctant to go to hospital.

“Definitely, if we are just counting COVID-confirmed deaths, we are underestimating the true death toll of COVID on Canadian society,” says Burlington, Ont., doctor Jennifer Kwan. Tweet This

“It is very important to have up-to-date, all-cause mortality data. If we are finding out a year later, or more, then that’s not really helpful for us in the current pandemic. That will only be helpful for us in planning for the next pandemic, and the long-term effects of this one.”

Ontario’s Vital Statistics Act only requires the province’s registrar-general to publish a report on vital statistics like births, marriages and deaths after the end of each year, related to the year before the one that just ended.

“Gathering and compiling the statistics for an annual report requires that vital events that occurred during the reporting year are properly registered, which must account for events that are submitted by individuals for registration up to 365 days after the event occurred,” provincial spokesperson Harry Malhi wrote in an e-mail.

[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]

“As a result, the mortality data you are requesting from death registrations is currently unavailable as the annual reports for 2019 and 2020 have not been published yet.”

That means that we can’t expect death data about the period we’re now living in until after the end of 2021, Malhi confirmed. (Ontario does publish daily totals of deaths formally attributed to coronavirus, but without numbers on deaths in general, it isn’t possible to see what may be being missed.)

Malhi did not respond to a question about whether mortality data could be released earlier than the deadline.

A spokesperson in Government and Consumer Services Minister Lisa Thompson’s office did not respond to questions about whether Ontario could start releasing data about death more promptly.

The U.K., by contrast, releases mortality data for the whole country every week; the most recent data release comes up to April 17.

Most Canadian provinces are far more sluggish about reporting death (B.C., which reports deaths monthly, is an exception), with the result that Statistics Canada’s national data on mortality only comes up to 2018.

“There are a lot of things to take into consideration,” Kwan says. “That being said, it sounds like a lot of European countries and the U.S. have been able to produce this sort of data and publish it on a weekly, if not monthly, basis. Hopefully, COVID-19 will allow us to expedite the process here.”

Doctors who submit death certificates to the province send the documents in quickly once they’re complete, Kwan says; the delay isn’t on their end.

“On the end of the person filling out the paperwork, that usually has to be done in a prompt time,” she says. “Depending on the province, it’s usually within 48 hours, or quicker if possible.”

Many things the health care system would normally do, like cancer screenings, are being delayed or cancelled because of pressure due to coronavirus, Kwan says.

“Right now, the medical system is very focused on treating acute COVID. Sometimes if things are considered non-urgent, tests are being delayed , procedures and surgeries.”

What will the consequences be? It’s hard to know, but timely data about deaths will help doctors understand, and react.

“We may see an increase in breast cancer, colon cancer or cervical cancer.”

“Having that all-cause mortality data would be important. So we see that maybe the number of strokes or heart attacks has significantly increased, so maybe it’s time for more public messaging to tell people: these are the signs and symptoms of a stroke or heart attack; do not ignore it, go to the hospital. ”

Quebec officials did not respond to a request for up-to-date mortality data from that province. Montreal’s public health department said the city does not keep mortality data at the local level.

Second in population only to China, India reported more than 2,600 new infections. In Russia, new cases exceeded 10,000 for the first time. The confirmed total death toll in Britain climbed near that of Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak, even though the U.K. population is younger than Italy’s and Britain had more time to prepare before the pandemic hit.

The United States continues to see tens of thousands of new infections each day, with more than 1,400 additional deaths reported Saturday.

Health experts have warned of a potential second wave of infections unless testing is expanded dramatically once the lockdowns are relaxed. But pressure to reopen keeps building after the weekslong shutdown of businesses worldwide plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.

12,"May 2, 2020",CTV News,Another wave of coronavirus will likely hit the U.S. in the fall,"The coronavirus pandemic may have slowed down in many parts of the country because of social distancing efforts but don't plan your parties, vacations or trips to the office just yet. Experts say the virus won't be a thing of the past any time soon.

A second round of COVID-19 cases is ""inevitable"" come fall, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said, as people increasingly try to resume regular life and more states ease or lift their stay-at-home orders.

""I'm almost certain it will come back, because the virus is so transmissible and it's globally spread,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci during an Economic Club of Washington webinar earlier this week.

Americans could be in for ""a bad fall and a bad winter"" if the country is unprepared, said Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Here's what we know about the possibility of a second wave of the virus and the reasoning behind it.

Why in the fall?

There are many aspects of the virus that remain unknown for scientists but older viruses are offering some clues.

People usually get infected by four common coronaviruses that were first identified in the mid-1960s, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those tend to peak in the winter months.

Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic, said that SARS-CoV-2, the technical name for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is likely to follow that pattern.

If that happens, a second wave of the virus would return just in time for the start of flu season. The flu has been a constant threat for Americans and devastating in recent years. The CDC estimates there were at least 39 million cases of the flu in the US and at least 24,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 season.

Poland, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, says the combination of a second wave of COVID-19 with flu season could create ""a lot of confusion"" because of their overlap in symptoms and put a heavy strain on the health care system.

It wouldn't be the first pandemic to come back in force. In 2009, the US experienced a wave of cases of the H1N1 influenza virus, known as swine flu, in the spring. Months later, a second wave was reported in the fall and winter, the CDC says.

""Often, not always ... often the second wave of a pandemic is worse,"" Poland said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic spread in the US well into the flu season.

Another example is the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed 50 million people globally and about 675,000 Americans. At the time, there was an initial mild spring wave in the US but a lethal second wave hit the country in September.

It appear that the novel coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months. There are several possible scenarios for the course of the pandemic but the worst of them is a second wave of infections just like the 1918 influenza pandemic, according to a report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

""This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70 percent of people,"" said Mike Osterholm, the CIDRAP director, in an interview with CNN.

""The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.""

Osterholm coauthored a CIDRAP report released Thursday that recommended the US prepare for a worst-case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.

What can be done about a second wave of infection?

Health experts say the coming months would be a good time to prepare for a potential second outbreak of the virus.

Hospitals and clinics should replenish their stocks of personal protective equipment and testing supplies. People should try to get healthier if possible, continue using face masks for the time being and keep gatherings to no more than 10 people, several experts told CNN.

As cities reopen, local officials should make plans to quickly reissue stay-at-home orders or other strict social distancing measures in the future if needed, Poland said

Health officials across the country must continue focusing on expanding coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment, said Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of the geographic medicine and infectious diseases division at Tufts University Medical Center.

""We hope we'll have more tools in our toolbox, maybe we'll have some treatments for COVID-19 by then, maybe we'll have better diagnostics,"" Boucher said.

The Trump administration has estimated a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away, though some leaders in the field say that timeline could be too fast.

Improving the way health workers handle the coronavirus pandemic will be key, Boucher says, so the country is ""as prepared as we can be"" when it's time to face an outbreak of both the coronavirus and the flu.

While most experts believe that people who have recovered from the virus will have some sort of immunity, Poland says it's unclear how strong that immunity might be, how long it might last and the accuracy of antibody tests is inconsistent.

""We are placing a lot of hope on that but we don't have answers yet,"" Poland said. ""This (virus) is only 16 weeks old so there's a lot we don't know yet.""

The experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir was approved on Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients in severe condition.

The drug, which is the first authorized treatment for COVID-19, is far from a cure, according to a government-funded study, but patients who took it recovered faster than patients who did not.

""We have work to do. We are looking for other therapies. This trial is going to continue,"" Dr. Andre Kalil, the principal investigation behind the clinical trial, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen earlier this week.

Has the virus made a comeback elsewhere?

Yes.

In recent weeks, Singapore has seen a dramatic spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories.

Singapore had initially been praised for its response and apparent ability to suppress infections in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic. Then the number of cases exploded in April.

Since March 17, Singapore's total cases grew from 266 to more than 17,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

To control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. It's a daunting task because workers live in cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible. The government also instituted what it is calling a ""circuit breaker,"" a package of restrictions and new rules, combined with harsh punishments.

The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong had a relatively small number of cases when it saw a spike after it relaxed restrictions in March. Many cases were imported from overseas as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- returned, bringing the virus back with them.",

Of the cases, there are now 832 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 992 in Fraser Health, 123 in Vancouver Island Health, 175 in Interior Health, and 49 in Northern Health.

Two more people have died of COVID-19, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 114. There are currently 72 people in hospital, and 23 people in intensive care.

Henry said there is one new community outbreak, at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, where there are now three confirmed cases. There remain 52 cases associated with an outbreak at Superior Poultry, and 35 cases associated with an outbreak at United Poultry.

She also expressed concern over an outbreak at the Kearl Lake oilsands facility north of Fort McMurray. She said with workers travelling between B.C. and Alberta, the outbreak remains ""very challenging"" to contain, and that anyone returning to B.C. should be self isolating.

""As cases continue to be found both in Alberta and here in B.C. this is very important for us, vitally important for us in B.C., that anyone who has been at the site since March 24 needs to follow our requirements in British Columbia when they are home,"" she said.

Watch Dr. Bonnie Henry's message to the class of 2020:

Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded students that schools are working hard to make graduation a positive and special event during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1:00

""This includes your entire family being very diligent about physical distancing, self isolating on your return. Part of our response here in B.C. to outbreaks in our communities is treating that entire area as an outbreak site.""

Henry said that though B.C. has flattened its curve and that new daily case numbers have been steady, the risk in B.C. remains ""very high.""

""It is far too easy to tip the scales against us,"" she said.

""We cannot have any missteps as we look to ease our restrictions in the coming weeks.""

'Safely, slowly, methodically'

Premier John Horgan has promised to release details next week on plans to gradually lift restrictions on daily life and business. Henry said she has faced pressure from both sides of the debate on how and when the province should re-open, especially as other Canadian provinces begin to ease restrictions, noting that measures implemented in B.C. have been ""less draconian.""

""We will not move forward with opening up different sectors until we're ready, until we're sure that we have a plan that is workable,"" she said.

""It is a bit of a cautionary tale for us that we have seen these outbreaks in these poultry plants, for example. That tells us that we need to make sure that we have the right safety measures in place in each different area of our economy to make sure that we can all be comforted and understand that we are opening up safely, slowly, and methodically.""

Henry also addressed students, and specifically the class of 2020, whose graduation ceremonies have been cancelled or driven online as a result of the pandemic.

""We won't be doing them in the same way this summer, but take heart we are thinking about that,"" she said.

""You are, and will always be unique in the graduating class. It's been over 100 years since we've had an event like this pandemic.""

Henry also spoke directly to parents and students struggling with homeschooling, as days spent at home stretch into weeks.

""I know many of us are feeling the fatigue and the frustration ... we want children across the province to continue learning, but there's many ways of learning,"" she said.

""There is no such thing as perfect. It is an unattainable concept and none of us should be striving for it.""

14,"May 3, 2020",CBC.ca,"China hid severity of the coronavirus to hoard supplies, U.S. intelligence documents allege","U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders ""intentionally concealed the severity"" of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday China was responsible for the spread of the disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government's response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump's political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ""for official use only,"" the analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by ""denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,"" the analysis states.

WATCH | War of words between Washington and Beijing over COVID-19:

An ongoing war of words between Washington and Beijing about the spread of COVID-19 is making it harder for scientists trying to find a way to end the pandemic. 2:18

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus ""was a contagion"" for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95 per cent probability that China's changes in imports and export behaviour were not within normal range, according to the report.

Trump has speculated that China could have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible ""mistake."" His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC's This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he said: ""Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.""

People use a carnival ride at a public park in Beijing on Saturday. (Mark Chiefelbein/The Associated Press)

""These are not the first times that we've had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work — they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain — I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.""

Chinese government bears 'enormous responsibility': Cruz

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion virtually word for word hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Speaking Sunday on Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas echoed that sentiment, saying he believes China ""is the most significant geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century.""

""The communist government in China bears enormous responsibility, enormous direct culpability for this pandemic. We know they covered it up,"" Cruz said.

""Had they behaved responsibly and sent in health professionals and quarantined those infected, there's a real possibility this could have been a regional outbreak, and not a global pandemic. And the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide are in a very real sense the direct responsibility of the communist Chinese government's lies.""",

As of 7:30 p.m. ET on Friday, Canada had 55,061 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases, with the majority concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. Provinces and territories list 22,762 of the cases as resolved or recovered. A CBC News tally of COVID-19-related deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting lists 3,507 deaths in Canada and two known coronavirus-related deaths of Canadians abroad.

Public health officials have cautioned that the recorded numbers are likely too low, noting that they fail to capture information on people who have not been tested or who are still under investigation as possible coronavirus cases. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has urged people to behave as though there is coronavirus in their community, even if there haven't been any recorded cases.

The novel coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. There is no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus, which first emerged in China in late 2019.

While the number of new cases has come off a peak of 104,495 reported in a single day last week, it is still at around 80,000 to 90,000 cases per day globally.

LIFTING LOCKDOWN?

In the United States, around half the country’s state governors partially reopened their economies over the weekend, while others, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, declared the move was premature.

In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who battled COVID-19 last month, said on Sunday the country was over the peak but it was still too early to relax lockdown measures.

Even in countries where the suppression of the disease has been considered successful, such as Australia and New Zealand which have recorded daily rates of new infections in the low single digits for weeks, officials have been cautious.

Note: This film is no longer available online.

One day, when the coronavirus pandemic is merely of historical concern, much time will be spent discussing its origins and evolution and evaluating its long-term effects.

But for now, for today, the coronavirus is still a matter of life and death.

With many already mourning the loss of loved ones, others fear they might be next. Billions of people around the world are still in some degree of lockdown, their lives on hold, their jobs on the line. Economies are imploding, overstretched health services are trying not to buckle under the strain and political leaders are struggling to find solutions to the biggest global challenge in decades.

So one question is uppermost: what is the best route out of this crisis?

An answer could lie in East Asia, where COVID-19 first appeared and where governments, with varying degrees of success, have tried different ways of defeating it.

18,"May 3, 2020",CTV News,"Russia sees record rise with 10,633 coronavirus cases in 24 hours","MOSCOW, RUSSIA -- Russia on Sunday reported a new record daily rise in coronavirus infections as the number of confirmed cases surged past 130,000.

As some European countries were looking to gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicentre of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home despite glorious weather.

With the number of cases rising by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.

Despite the increases, the government has indicated it could gradually lift confinement measures from May 12, depending on the region.

According to the government's daily coronavirus update, 10,633 confirmed infections were reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 134,687.

President Vladimir Putin has said the situation remains ""very difficult"" and warned that the country was not yet past the peak of the outbreak.

Russia's official fatality rate has remained low in comparison to countries like Italy, Spain and the United States.

Fifty-eight people died over the past 24 hours, bringing the total toll to 1,280.

The authorities are preparing to set up temporary field hospitals around Moscow including at the VDNKh, the famed Soviet-era outdoor exhibition centre, in case infections continue to surge.

Muscovites have been under lockdown since March 30 and in mid-April, the authorities introduced a system of digital permits to reduce violations of the restrictions.

They have warned that the rules may be tightened further.

Residents of the Russian capital are only allowed to leave their homes to walk their dogs, take out trash and visit their nearest shop although private car journeys have not been restricted up to now.

Many complained that it was increasingly difficult to observe the quarantine as the weather was getting warmer.

In a sprawling park in southwest Moscow on Sunday, a two-person police patrol asked parents with small children to respect the confinement rules and return home.

THREAT 'ON THE RISE'

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Saturday urged residents to continue to respect stay-at-home rules and other measures over the long May holidays.

""The threat is apparently on the rise,"" Sobyanin said on his blog.

Earlier this week Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev tested positive for the coronavirus and were hospitalised.

Mishustin's first deputy Andrei Belousov is now serving as acting prime minister.

Mishustin's spokesman Boris Belyakov told reporters on Sunday that the prime minister was feeling fine and was in touch with his colleagues.

The health ministry said on Friday that the number of infected children was on the rise. Two children had died from the coronavirus and 11 more were in a serious condition.

Moscow alone has recorded 5,948 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the capital's total to 68,606.

Sobyanin said about two per cent of Moscow residents -- or more than 250,000 people -- have the coronavirus.

According to official statistics, Moscow has a population of 12.7 million but the real figure is believed to be higher.

Putin has postponed a landmark military parade to honour the 75th anniversary of Soviet victory in the Second World War on May 9.

He has also postponed an April vote on constitutional reforms that could allow the 67-year-old Kremlin chief to potentially stay in power until 2036.",

An Ottawa biotech company is voluntarily recalling a rapid test for COVID-19 after Health Canada expressed concern about its effectiveness, dealing a setback to expanded testing in the country.

Spartan Bioscience said Sunday that the concerns centre around the proprietary swab used in the test, but that the Health Canada report out Friday did not raise concerns about the accuracy of the test reagents and portable analyzer device.

The company said it would recall the 5,500 tests shipped nationally and work on additional clinical studies to assess the sampling method and swab.

India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Friday said India — the country with the largest number of people in lockdown — would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts.

As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu — meaning Health Bridge — a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country’s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.

“Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.

It will be the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations “to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees,” the ministry said.

Officials at India’s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.

The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India’s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.

The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.

“Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.

New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.

The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.

On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.

India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

23,"May 1, 2020",The Globe and Mail,Four investing lessons from the coronavirus pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic has been horrible on so many levels. It’s been horrible for the thousands of Canadians who have been infected, for the more than one million people who have lost their jobs and – like I need to tell you – it’s been horrible for your portfolio.

But here’s the good news: We’re constantly learning more about the virus, how to treat it and the most effective ways to contain its spread. These lessons will help us gradually re-open the economy and, ultimately, better prepare us for the next global pandemic.

What’s the connection with investing, you ask? Well, just as scientists and governments are learning important lessons, investors are getting a crash course in crisis portfolio management. In the spirit of taking something positive from a horrible situation, here are some key investing lessons we’ve learned.

Story continues below advertisement

Don’t sell into a panic

When the market is plunging, it can be tempting to sell your stocks to make the pain go away. But then what? After crystallizing your losses, you’ll be sitting on the sidelines wondering when it’s safe to get back in. By the time you work up the courage, you may have missed much of the recovery.

Investors who sold during the worst of the recent market meltdown are probably kicking themselves. From its Feb. 20 high to its March 23 low, the S&P/TSX Composite Index plummeted 6,7155.57 points, or 37.4 per cent. But by the end of April, the benchmark had recouped more than half of its point loss. As the economy re-opens and scientists find more treatments and possibly a vaccine for the virus, the market will likely continue to recover.

Instead of panic selling, a better strategy is to build a diversified portfolio of high-quality stocks and fixed-income investments and – as difficult as it may be – hold them through thick and thin.

Utilities are your friend

I’m a big fan of utilities and other companies with regulated or contracted cash flows, such as power producers, pipelines and infrastructure stocks. During a crisis, these stocks can provide much-needed stability.

Consider Fortis Inc., an electric and gas utility with operations in Canada, the United States and the Caribbean. The shares initially plunged with the rest of the market, but by the middle of this week they had clawed their way back to within 5 per cent of their pre-pandemic high. Other utilities stocks have also held up relatively well: Through April 30, the S&P/TSX Capped Utilities Index posted a year-to-date total return (including dividends) of negative 1.5 per cent, compared with a total return of negative 12.4 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.

“We expect the defensive attributes of the regulated utilities will cause them to hold up well even in a recession,” David Quezada, an analyst with Raymond James, said in a recent note. Another plus: Utilities, power, pipeline and infrastructure stocks offer well-covered dividends that rise over time. That’s why these companies account for roughly 40 per cent of my model Yield Hog Dividend Growth Portfolio (view it online at tgam.ca/dividendportfolio).

Don’t invest in things you don’t understand

“Has DFN suspended its dividend?” an anxious reader asked me recently. “I have owned it for many years and it is an important part of my income.” The reader was referring to Dividend 15 Split Corp. and, unfortunately, the class A shares – which had been yielding a risky-looking 13 per cent before the coronavirus hit – had indeed suspended distributions in March when the stock market collapsed.

Story continues below advertisement

Like many investors, this reader didn’t understand the risks of split shares. Such confusion is understandable, given that split share corporations offer two types of shares – split preferred shares and capital (or class A) shares – with vastly different characteristics. The split preferreds offer a modest payout and are relatively safe; they have first dibs on dividends spun off by an underlying portfolio of stocks and also get first claim on the capital of the underlying portfolio, up to a certain amount.

The class A shares, on the other hand, are more volatile. They are entitled to all of the value in the underlying portfolio over and above what the preferreds get. When times are good and the portfolio rises in value, the class A shares do well because they are, in effect, a leveraged play on the underlying stocks. But when stock prices plunge and the capital in the portfolio falls below a certain threshold, the class A shares are required to stop paying distributions (which are often funded by the sale of options on the underlying stocks). In such instances, the class A shares get crushed. Not only has DFN not paid a distribution for two consecutive months, but its share price as of April 30 was down about 44 per cent from its levels in late February. One way to avoid such nasty surprises is to stick with investments you understand.

Don’t forget fixed-income

When stock markets are surging, it’s easy to pooh-pooh fixed-income securities. Who wants to earn a measly 2 per cent annually when you can make many times that in stocks? It’s only when a bear market hits that investors wish they had more exposure to bonds or guaranteed investment certificates. Some investors can handle the volatility of an all-equity portfolio, but most are grateful for the stability that fixed-income provides. The lesson here is that you shouldn’t wait for a pandemic or other crisis to remind you that you have more equity exposure than you can stomach.

24,"May 1, 2020",Globalnews.ca,Coronavirus: Public transit will not be ‘business as usual’ after reopening,"The gradual reopening of Canada’s economy will not mean business as usual for the country’s public transit agencies.

Despite the fact that a slowly growing number of workers will make their way back to the country’s buses, streetcars and subways as they return to workplaces shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems that will help get them there say they anticipate maintaining measures that took effect while most of their riders were in lockdown.

Reduced service levels, limited seating and enhanced cleaning protocols will still be in place, several transit agencies said, acknowledging that even more steps may come into play over time but declining to offer details.

“COVID has changed everything for us,” said Anne Marie Aikins, spokesman for Ontario regional transit provider Metrolinx that operates the heavily travelled GO Transit network. “That’s not going to disappear overnight.”

Story continues below advertisement

Aikins said most of the more than 40 pandemic-related measures implemented since the beginning of the year will remain in effect. Riders returning to Go Transit after their enforced hiatus will find their commutes looking different, she said, noting trains and buses now have hand sanitizer dispensers on board and drivers seated behind protective shields.

Several seats have been blocked off in the interest of both protecting Metrolinx staff and encouraging passengers to maintain the standard physical distancing barrier of two metres, she said.

Those commuters still making use of Go services have not struggled to find seats, Aikins said, noting ridership has plunged 90 per cent since widespread shutdowns took effect in mid-March.

The decline meant Go was forced to scale back its services to 50 per cent of typical capacity, but Aikins said Metrolinx tailored remaining routes to align with hospital shift changes, grocery store hours and other scheduling constraints in play for the essential workers still making a daily commute.

Story continues below advertisement

The disparity between ridership and service levels, she said, means Go Transit has room to adjust to the gradual increase of traffic expected when Ontario’s economy begins to reopen in the coming weeks.

Similar conversations are taking place at the Toronto Transit Commission, according to spokesman Stuart Green.

The transit provider, which temporarily laid off 1,200 employees amid an 85 per cent drop in ridership, is still running between 70 to 80 per cent of its usual routes in a bid to accommodate essential workers and those reliant on public transit for crucial errands and medical visits.

Green said those workers will start gradually returning as passengers find their way back onto public transit, but said several challenges remain as the TTC tries to find ways of maintaining both operations and public safety.

“It’s very much a balancing act,” Green said. “It’s one of continuing to provide service for people who need it now and being able to accommodate people as they start coming back assuming that there may be certain requirements around physical distancing that we’ll have to keep in mind.”

Some of those requirements were spelled out in guidelines released earlier this week by Ontario’s Health and Safety Association. The recommendations pertaining to transit employers have already been largely implemented at Metrolinx and the TTC, according to their respective spokespeople.

Ottawa’s transit provider, OCTranspo, issued a statement saying it would be guided by industry best practices.

“OCTranspo will be ready to adapt the way we provide transit services to meet customer demand and will consult with public health officials as recovery plans evolve in order to provide a safe environment for our customers and employees,” transit customer systems and planning director Pat Scrimgeour said, without providing further details.

Similar approaches are unfolding in parts of the country whose return to pre-pandemic norms seems more imminent.

Demands on local transit systems will likely increase in Alberta beginning as early as Monday when most health services in the province are allowed to resume. Retailers and personal services will be allowed to start opening their doors 10 days later on May 14.

In Winnipeg, where some businesses will reopen effective Monday, City Emergency Operation Centre Manager Jay Shaw said buses will continue to run on a reduced schedule, adding more vehicles if physical distancing is becoming too difficult to enforce with existing resources.

Such concerns are on the minds of transit employees, according to the union representing TTC workers.

Carlos Santos, President of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, praised efforts to equip workers with protective equipment, redistribute seating and reconfigure vehicle boarding protocols in a bid to keep staff safe.

But he said more proactive steps will be needed to ensure employee health as transit operations gradually ramp up.

“I think what they’re going to have to start doing is putting in markers at stations and putting markers on platforms … just like they have in other cities in the world that have started to reopen,” Santos said.

International examples could serve Canada’s transit systems well in the months ahead, according to one industry observer.

Amer Shalaby, professor of transportation engineering at the University of Toronto, said countries further ahead in the COVID-19 recovery process have implemented a variety of measures to keep transit safe for all.

He said authorities in South Korea clean and sanitize mass transit vehicles up to five times a day.

In the Netherlands, meanwhile, he said the government is developing a mobile app that will help manage crowds by allowing riders to make reservations on local buses and trains. Such a system, he said, also allows services to be prioritized for essential workers and those without alternative means of transportation.

But regardless of how Canada’s transit operators proceed in the post-pandemic world, he said governments should be prepared to help keep them afloat.

The federal government must obtain “meaningful consent” from Canadians if it wants them to use any future smartphone app to digitally track coronavirus cases, the country’s privacy commissioner says.

In an interview with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson on The West Block, Daniel Therrien said he agrees with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s comments last week that such an app should be voluntary to earn public support.

But he added that the app’s design must be done properly, and meet a series of criteria, in order to balance privacy concerns with public health needs.

“It’s not a question of either having public health protection or privacy. It is possible to have both at the same time,” Therrien said.

“But there is no question that privacy is engaged with these obligations.”

Therrien listed some of the important privacy safeguards he said any contact tracing app should have before it’s introduced to the public.

The most important, he said, is that the app only collects location and health data for public health purposes, not for commercial or “state surveillance” purposes.

He also said that data should stay on the user’s phone as de-identified and “aggregate” information.

“Information should be sent to the government public health authorities so that they can monitor trends at a general level, but not know where each individual is,” he explained.

Story continues below advertisement

Therrien also said users should know what they’re signing up for, with the government clearly laying out how their data will be used in order to achieve meaningful consent.

Finally, the commissioner said the data collected through the app should only be kept for a limited time period — in this case, when the threat of the pandemic is over — and destroyed once that time period ends.

Trudeau and deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo both said Wednesday that Ottawa is looking into the potential of using smartphone apps to digitally trace contacts of identified coronavirus cases.

The prime minister said “a number of proposals and companies working on different models” may be adopted by Canada, but said privacy is a top consideration.

“As we move forward on taking decisions, we’re going to keep in mind that Canadians put a very high value on their privacy, on their data security,” he said. “We need to make sure we respect that even in a time of emergency measures and significant difficultly.”

Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said both contact tracing and widespread testing are crucial to implement before the economy, which has been largely locked down across the globe to limit the spread of COVID-19, can reopen on a wide scale.

Yet Tam also said on Wednesday that she’s also concerned about the mistakes that could be made by contact tracing apps if not developed properly, particularly the chance of false positives.

“Those kinds of characteristics [are] not what you want to have because that would alarm a whole bunch of people. They may then show up to be tested when in fact they were not at risk,” Tam said.

On Friday, Alberta — which has already begun taking steps to re-emerge from its coronavirus lockdown — became the first jurisdiction in Canada to introduce such an app. The province said its ABTraceTogether app was developed in close contact with Therrien’s office and appears to follow his important privacy safeguards.

The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner’s guidelines for governments to follow during the COVID-19 crisis includes those same safeguards while underlining the need for transparency in introducing any extraordinary measures.

Therrien said his office’s framework has been delivered to the federal government for consideration, but added Ottawa has not reached out for advice on how to develop a contact tracing app.

“They know where we live, so they have our framework and we have offered our services,” he said. “That’s where things stand.”

Australia last month rolled out a voluntary coronavirus tracking app as part of its effort to combat the spread of the virus. In other countries, citizens don’t get a choice.

South Korea amended its laws early in 2020 to let health officials track location data from cellphones, car navigation systems and credit-card systems to keep tabs on its citizens.

Therrien said if Canada chose to make its app mandatory — or felt it had no other choice but to do so — his safeguards would become even more important to gain the public’s trust.

But he echoed Tam’s concerns over the effectiveness of such an app, and said if people are forced to use it, it must be unimpeachable.

“In order to meet privacy safeguards, the measure must be necessary and proportionate — that is, science-based,” he said.

“If it became mandatory, it would be extremely important that the application be found to be effective.”

Privacy watchdogs are voicing concerns over proposals across the country to implement smartphone apps to help track COVID-19.

New Brunswick, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan are among the provinces looking at or planning on creating smartphone apps that would track a user’s whereabouts.

Alberta is the first province to launch an app.

Known as contact tracing, the apps track those who the user comes in to contact with, commonly by monitoring a device’s Bluetooth signal.

The use of the technology, and the information the apps gather, has become a subject of debate in Canada.

“When we develop these sorts of tools or applications, we’re entering into a totally new class or form of surveillance,” said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Policy. “We’ve never had that level of surveillance in this country.”

Parsons, whose research focuses on data privacy and security, said governments may have good intentions but they need to be prepared for the long-term implications of collecting such data.

“If the government doesn’t communicate what government organizations can or can’t collect with any kind of tracing application, it will almost certainly disenfranchise individuals,” he said.

1:14 Coronavirus outbreak: Trudeau government weighing privacy, data security vs. need for contract tracing Coronavirus outbreak: Trudeau government weighing privacy, data security vs. need for contract tracing

The reaction at various government levels to creating and implementing the apps has been mixed.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government has received a number of proposals but understands that Canadians value their privacy and need certain assurances.

Alberta launched its app, called ABTraceTogether, on Friday. It uses Bluetooth signals to track users and if you’re diagnosed with COVID-19, it will contact those you may have come into contact with.

The province said no identifiable information is exchanged between the app users and geolocation data will not be collected.

A spokesman for New Brunswick’s Ministry of Health said its app would allow those diagnosed with COVID-19 to send an anonymous message to those they have come in contact with.

Other provinces are taking a wait-and-see approach.

British Columbia is not looking at contact tracing apps at this time, while a spokesperson for Ontario’s Health Ministry said no decision has been made.

Only Quebec has strongly pushed back against using contact tracing technology and apps.

“Geolocation cannot replace the contact tracing actions carried out by the public-health departments. In addition, it must not at any time make it possible to identify an individual, in particular, a person suffering from COVID-19,” the Quebec Health Ministry said in a statement.

The discussion prompted Canada’s privacy commissioner to release a framework for governments. It says collected data should be destroyed when the pandemic ends and that measures must be science-based and “necessary to achieve a specific identified purpose.”

“During a crisis, laws can be applied flexibly and contextually, but they must still apply. Our framework aims to focus on what we believe are the most relevant principles in context, without abandoning others,” said commissioner Daniel Therrien.

Dr. Peter Phillips, an infectious disease expert at the University of British Columbia, said privacy rights aren’t the only issue and Canadians need to make sacrifices based on the benefit for public health.

“Rather than just assuming this is an unacceptable intrusion on people’s privacy, there are potentially substantial benefits to be had by having public health response use technology,” he said in an interview.

Phillips agreed that privacy issues must be handled carefully.

“The rights of those people who are not yet infected with COVID need to be taken into account as well, because if we don’t do everything that we can to contain this by way of public health, then people are going to get sick and some of them will die.”

Other countries using such apps are promising to keep a close eye on how the data is used and shared.

Australia launched COVIDSafe and has promised to take only minimal data from its users. Italy has decreed that the information its app collects will remain anonymous and be destroyed by the end of the year.

The rise in popularity of the apps even prompted a joint effort from Google and Apple to allow programming interfaces to work together to share data. Those with Android or Apple smartphone products will both be able to better share data to allow developers to create tracing apps.

The plan, the companies said, is to launch Bluetooth tracing software in the coming months.

In Canada, there are concerns about oversight and guidelines on how the information will be shared.

“It really is an extraordinary invasion of privacy for a democratic state to request,” said Brenda McPhail, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s privacy, technology and surveillance project.

She said there would need to be an equally extraordinary level of oversight.

Geoffrey Rotstein, CEO of Toronto company EQ Works, said he’s aware of the concerns.

His company is developing an app that would track a smartphone’s Bluetooth technology but would keep a user’s data stored on their phone, not a server.

“We believe we could develop something that becomes a very proactive notification tool,” he said. “So, we can proactively identify people in places at risk and help protect people’s lives and help get life back to normal faster.”

Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said this week that in addition to privacy concerns, the technology itself remains unproven and will need to be refined to ensure false positives and other issues do not emerge.

Yet over a dozen nations continue to report they have not seen a single case.

The rogue nation’s health ministry has continued to report zero cases in weekly updates to the World Health Organization, the WHO’s representative to North Korea Edwin Salvador told the Associated Press in late April.

In its most recent update, Salvador said the ministry had tested 740 people for the coronavirus as of April 17 and no one tested positive. Tens of thousands of people have been quarantined to date as they await testing, according to WHO reports.

Yet doubts remain, particularly as North Korea shares a border with China, which remains its primary trading partner. While that land border has been closed since January, goods are still being brought in by sea, officials in both countries have confirmed.

Defectors and experts have told the Associated Press that the North Korean regime is likely lying about the lack of infections, saying the regime wants nothing to be seen as a threat to leader Kim Jong Un’s rule. They also argue the country’s medical system has never fully recovered after collapsing in the 1990s and suffering through the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks of the 2000s.

A week later, reporters cited sources claiming nearly 200 soldiers “from several branches of the military” have died from suspected coronavirus symptoms. None of the reports have been independently verified.

North Korea’s main newspaper recently called its public health system “the most superior in the world” and said that Kim Jong Un’s devotion to improving it is the reason why there are no infections, according to the AP.

The autocratic ex-Soviet country has gone even further than North Korea, with officials and state-controlled media not even using the word “coronavirus,” according to Reporters Without Borders. The free speech advocacy organization says the word has also been removed from health information brochures distributed in schools, hospitals and workplaces.

But Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov told a briefing in late April that its official data is true and the country is “not hiding anything,” according to Reuters.

Only one African country, Lesotho, has not yet confirmed a case of coronavirus — even though the nation is landlocked within South Africa, which has seen nearly 6,000 cases and over 100 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The government closed the borders in mid-March, and declared a national state of emergency shortly afterwards, in efforts to keep any potential cases out. According to local media reports, the measures were also introduced because the country “doesn’t have testing capability.”

As of May 1, the country’s health ministry reported 31 suspected cases of COVID-19 had come back negative.

The government’s response has also been hampered by a scandal surrounding Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, who is being pushed to resign over allegations he and his current wife plotted the assassination of the leader’s previous wife. The couple have denied the allegations.

Ten island nations in the Pacific Ocean are so far free of the coronavirus, along with the Cook Islands, which is technically part of New Zealand yet has its own autonomous government.

Prime Minister Henry Puna declared the Cook Islands “a COVID-19 free zone” on April 29, with over 1,200 negative tests so far. Travellers are still being barred from entering, yet restrictions on large gatherings were lifted this week.

The other nations — Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu — imposed some of the harshest travel restrictions in the world as early as February. The islands are key tourist destinations, meaning borders had to be locked down fast to avoid the spread of the virus.

According to Slate, the Federated States of Micronesia’s travel ban is the toughest of all. Anyone who has visited any country with just a single confirmed coronavirus case is barred from entering any of Micronesia’s islands. Citizens are also forbidden from visiting any country with a case count.

Yet the lockdowns have come at a cost: with tourism revenue nosediving, countries are diverting funds to help their economies. Governments are doing their best to shoulder the financial burden of the pandemic, however, with Palau’s President Tommy Remengesau telling Reuters he will keep his borders closed “as long as necessary.”

Vanuatu was also hit hard by Cyclone Harold in mid-April, forcing the government to announce a second state of emergency on top of the one declared to counter the pandemic. Delivery of cyclone relief supplies were delayed due to coronavirus contamination fears, the Guardian reported.

Antarctica remains the last continent on Earth with no coronavirus cases, but scientists based there are preparing for the worst.

Experts speaking to NBC News say measures put in place to prevent outbreaks from developing — including quarantines, cuts to winter staff at research bases, and even outright bans on social gatherings — may have to remain in place for months, potentially until the end of the year.

That could mean the end of some research programs entirely.

“There will … be implications for the next austral summer field season,” said Stephanie Short, who heads Antarctic logistics for the National Science Foundation. “The exact extent of that impact is yet to be determined.”
